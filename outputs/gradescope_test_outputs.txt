So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision making, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take out of the so-called rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you're going to the doctor and the physician says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease attack the heart, <unk>
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even if you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistics <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think this is?
How many people have to take it before you can help someone else's before you can help you?
300.
This according to the research of researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid just a heart attack, stroke, or a <unk> event.
Now maybe think, "Well, one chance in 300 to my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a further statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things -- <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, I'm still going to take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you can do this over time, so they don't have to make the reasoning of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be <unk> by the drug that help you help you.
I don't say they should not be <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with his doctor.
<unk> medical ethics is a part of the principle of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that most of them is done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat it is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice many times, they want a shorter life <unk> or a longer life that might have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that talk about and think about now, with your family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a whole bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face of the face with a predatory system, you don't need the <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, not react to you, they could get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those times of stress is the logical logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think of the future how those <unk> could be in order to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent bad things in the first place.
I went back to the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor to settled on a combination of combination with the door, with a key key to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of a <unk> tree -- there is that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the <unk> and over the time of time, it mixed with local <unk> and developed the language we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, are really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a <unk> world is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like <unk> and <unk> the sound.
They <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people responds.
So I have learned for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't have the covered in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's for coming next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do the fact with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just had four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk> more of art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you not only experience through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience it visually, or even an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all they had taught me as the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, social currency, <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to love me.
There is a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me, equal to my voice.
And in that way, I'm able to be relevant in our society.
So in school, in school, I work with a lot of different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I am able to hold a temporary form of value as well as taking a temporary <unk> rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could <unk> it in the <unk> and you don't have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- I think in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and the <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and to express fully on the paper.
And the same can be said to be said in <unk>
The two are very <unk> highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> split up in many different <unk> parameters, <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger as you play the piano, the body movement, the <unk> the speed, the speed, the speed, the way that you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get just a button at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If you just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to music as the <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and he's wearing.
This is all the day."
If you get it, and you <unk> the visual speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel that you can say it can be said to <unk> it."
All right.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and a dramatic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> the same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on top.
Now we're going to do it so much in my head as well as <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, so good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages worldwide.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third Please <unk> again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar -- everybody in the head and the chest. But they pass very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> live and live, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound, it automatically has social value.
We have to start questioning what social value defines and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you need to hear music.
<unk> is a rich, trove and I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a ignorance bubble -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and they're not really good at cleaning the other people.
The time country, now I'm an adult and invention of the invention of Hong Kong in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't <unk>
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of <unk>
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big <unk> and networks, to collect those plastic chunks of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it's hard for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, six to 15 years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to convince them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting plastic pieces, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children were very much <unk> with the robots.
And then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we will transform light bulbs and chambers and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly by the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the plastic chunks of plastic through the sensor, while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this <unk> invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it to do it.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I asked my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, you get to do it, and you get <unk> with this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, only using the hands of the <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> the water in which they <unk> the water where the water is <unk> the place where they live.
You can see that the water is brown the mud and the oil is also brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of chemicals that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also close to me.
I'm half of Japanese and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it <unk> several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports between 300 tons of tons of tons are still being made of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go on the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation goes from the coast of <unk> and most of the time, it has <unk> it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the crash and research, independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we reported to the <unk> center, you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Along with them we argue the data that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> in order to represent real-time data from <unk> and water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear <unk> to date.
We zoom in to a mile of the nuclear <unk> and with the fishermen of fishermen from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source and very simple source technology.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of so much so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we convert it into the larger space and the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environment.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry, a little chemistry, basically, you can build almost everything in there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with the help of adults and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or can we help the mobility of the age of age that are advanced to transforming their own standard wheels in new <unk> vehicles.
<unk> and oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the kids in the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So <unk> scientists, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite <unk>
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one string of silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic thing.
One is imposes on the environment, I thought it would be <unk>
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool by <unk>
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we carry all the information needed it for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that's done in the <unk> world, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk> in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> are more thick with small <unk>
You act mostly as a filter that is primarily like barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that builds its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here is a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism between the assembly and the growth, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, and <unk> and <unk> shows you at two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment in history, where you have four disciplines that offers designers and the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scale, large-scale <unk> like this robotic arm with a <unk> extent with a <unk> basis, that some day not very far to print the <unk> and <unk> graphics made of <unk> genetically modified <unk>
So here we <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient architectural architecture, and it's created a screen where every groove is the only size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with <unk> 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D <unk> between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair to the comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and in designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material itself.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious desk, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree.
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was <unk>
Instead, the Earth was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects were done by a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material that is <unk> the kind of material in the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune into their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal.  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material that and create these structures made of one material made of three feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, you dry it to dry it to find a natural way in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed genetically engineered to capture very quickly of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition up with no problem of beam noises) and if it grows even more on the window.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing, you get two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human genome.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
And in order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that is <unk> to the tract -- that will help us <unk> these bacteria and they <unk> their function of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk> <unk>
If we wanted to be more <unk> you have more transparent channels.
This <unk> system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer camp and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are unique <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if the design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the burning tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit in biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer is known as a 3D printer <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which <unk>
<unk> is not going to be <unk> about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, you put those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first becomes a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with machines, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch in a flat <unk> not inside a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the smooth silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms, <unk> into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat, <unk> the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms from silk to an online farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they get <unk> and then life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
When you get biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
An <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give products to products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back to the beginning, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new design of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the design of us for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused you some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and the art and created websites -- besides playing the guitar into a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling of, it's not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was struck by the other thing, which is completely different, and I got involved in it, and I'll let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me so much anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure what was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason why it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story, and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you to get up then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where you <unk> you learned about culture.
And we asked us first "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would <unk>
It's considered a naive question to cause nice responses to children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
I <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question gets us over and over again as we grow in a different ways, we will be <unk> to high school students ask them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise before what the sleep is.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream what might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of everything you might be.
In fact, it does the opposite. Because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned on <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real vocation, the idea that every one of us has something to be engaged during its time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that show up your curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath in this way.
It could help you divide into three parts: potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the day, the ideal was the ideal who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three <unk> <unk>
One: synthesis.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> its shared interests on cartography, visualizing the mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And the <unk> with all of their background, you can access a lot of these intersection.
The second superpower, <unk> is very fast learning.
When we <unk> we interested in something, we're going to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for being a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of proving new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we rarely started from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a little girl, <unk> an incredible capacity to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a <unk> <unk> it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when he was starting their <unk> and this ability to write the compelling cartoon for editors to the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to go to what you're going to ask you, even if you get it <unk>
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. That is the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, a thousand web pages -- sometimes consultant as a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to be able to meet the market needs to be <unk>
<unk> of ideas and rapid learning, and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly by knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best equipment is made up of a <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are <unk> with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once there is one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, you know, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realized about being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity on those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal <unk> leads to a better and happier.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and they found weird and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we couldn't give it to her more aid than the one that <unk> gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit of progress has been moved on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
<unk> now affects 40 million around the world.
But 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the chance for Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two of two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or <unk>
Only in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease today and their costs will increase five times in 2050, 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot cure or cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times a year in cancer research than Alzheimer's with the fact that Alzheimer's costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain compared to the HIV patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to contributing a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's is significantly the life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's is <unk> and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> is a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There's places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> between each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of which step blocked is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step of it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other inside of them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive results, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We must be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of his loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not the most genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience of testing it, I was a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be <unk> to be 36 increasingly personal and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions about example.
Number two: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When did it be the last time you <unk>
And <unk>
So <unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, or to her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've just met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we got <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column that I send him to a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you are probably wondering: they keep together <unk>
And the reason I think you ask this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousand views.
And that turns out a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I was over, I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and I already Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had been called <unk> Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million <unk> and I was, to say something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people all around the world are actually interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they would first first question: keep you together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And there are several messages came up immediately.
These were students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman screamed to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared to the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of the readers by proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public onset together.
<unk> interviews, and he refused to <unk> pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love, not just a adventure, but real love, <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, above all, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you <unk> together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 times less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to make romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But study it worked.
The participants felt closer to doing it. Several <unk> studies, also used <unk> protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating confidence and interaction between strangers.
They've used to be used between members of the police and the community, and they've used them between people from the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer -- that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal university university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk>
And I said, "You want to say that you love the person with whom you <unk>
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
They became better friends?
<unk> that we did get better to get to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all of my adult life, and he was my first <unk> and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I had taken into science.
I did all I find out all I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to research for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what you get.
But I can also see me more clearly -- and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than they reasonably can demand me.
What I look for for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that media told people about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk and this is a very <unk> story because a fall in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, <unk> still together?
And their content with a response or No.
So more than a question, would I submit that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a <unk> or even more, how do you live with doubt about your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more thoughtful conversation about what to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of the story of my relationship, it's to <unk> a year ago, a known year, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are <unk> still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think how many times we would make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before, if he always chose me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, I have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what I <unk> and what I might spend my life looking for is that this myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a <unk> <unk> and in a way, I came like a <unk> of the forest.
 I have a long time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you <unk> a dollar ticket a pen and a fork in some place in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's kind of <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, he was in <unk> <unk> like going from <unk> and <unk> and all of those <unk> things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, somehow it seemed to grow up size, as if it was that we would get the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements this time, and we started adding electronic elements, and all I could find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you can say you can get an idea.
Then I made a few insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural <unk> with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
<unk> long.
It has twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, he's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're in the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So here's where creatures with animal heads are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god <unk> <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> bin Laden, and there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out of oil in a hand while the other hand goes out of the other hand, and it spits out in a hand while from the other hand there.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So that's what <unk> looks like.
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird's bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn off to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
Their tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made of terrorist cards in 1986.
They've got <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at its time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> or dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, it's <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can get the <unk>
I'm going to see you over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it takes the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There's some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a musician -- a musician -- a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we come together to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries -- the boundaries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very handmade.
And if we don't start to swap those things out of sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill that has effect against pain, first of the <unk> the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take <unk> drugs, these are the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase the <unk> cells.
But they are also known by its side effects on their own negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood -- it becomes <unk> and worse for the time that it would take it to your destiny, which is where most importantly, in the store of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go into the bloodstream, of the patients that are being tested with regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great deal of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life that is <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> for wounds and wounds and diabetes -- you can use it for anything <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, and they open up and close holes -- almost the infected cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser beam on the cell membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk>
We're now testing this technology in vitro and plates, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it runs the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it frees it directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation into non-violent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors here.
For example, the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed between a state and <unk> <unk>
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they <unk> how they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political fight are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global worldview.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Bank since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply fire.
They're multitasking <unk>
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations, radio stations, Internet <unk> websites and social networking strategies.
And here you have the <unk> magazine printed in English and published <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fundraising but through <unk> <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to try and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running a professional training training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not be security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan is torn by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be tested using the efforts of these groups by providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> <unk>
But in general, providing social services that means filling up a vacuum gap, a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the <unk> election in 2006 was <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid together.
<unk> because they fill gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups, and political groups participate in violent nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can find it as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of an territory, and they run all their <unk> collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations and <unk> and the stronger the weak the states, like in the Middle East, the more <unk> and they fill that gap the <unk> actors and <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups to have to invest more in tools.
<unk> that <unk> of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace together.
If we better understand groups -- we will understand better than to prevent the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, the military power can win some battle, but we're not giving peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the <unk> label it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I <unk> as a bad feminist thing.
Or, at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews -- people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke is meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I <unk> myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which gets too much, high self-esteem and dares to believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> and violence.
We have a right to use it for easy and accessible to contraceptives and services on them.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have to account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social and skills and much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and offends me, deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt.
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical thoughts.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  all the <unk> tasks but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> and maintenance maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> from magazines and <unk> things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, she's his choice, and I'm not who you have to.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, <unk> that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that's ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay workers, gay women and <unk> women and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's a good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist <unk>
It also happens the following. As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be perfection.
When we <unk> we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> before I tried to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear of what that label is because of fear I couldn't be able to achieve with <unk>
Take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show -- looking at this star of <unk> to take this star of <unk> to be able to know the women and the young men that will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless debates if it was or not quite a feminist.
It will be <unk> instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
We <unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> Feminism from any woman, <unk> until it wasn't there.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question was, or rather, a more <unk> feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action to action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a human supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions should be more difficult for women to make equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of three and four years old.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and too <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
where they were <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of all of a sudden, the best option was <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports in professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, the men especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, engaging in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help them to be included even more like ourselves to overcome the barriers to <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little action acts and hope that our decisions will get to the top, and people in the power of film and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, more courageous, and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery of us -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist doesn't be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a incident to deal with what happened.
Some guys <unk> me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as though it was anything.
I started believing it was nothing.
I would call my voice, and after I didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and <unk> I also found that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I get the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little brave when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases.
There is an effective vaccine against this more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being an fraud, <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the <unk> of autism in time.
During the most of the 20th century, autism would considered a very rare disease.
The very few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about she create a whole professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence was continued to steady just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> referred to routinely as an epidemic, as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of her two years, the visual contact for you.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that described 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds, private worlds, <unk> people around it, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their hands for their faces, but they were prey from panic for <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in its usual place, without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For 1950, as major authority in the world in the subject, I found that I had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome while <unk> references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine percent of 10 children sent to her office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> <unk> for cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept them carefully in a fridge I don't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that you put together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 steps before they hit the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
And her husband and her husband were warm and <unk> and they had a high autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more beautiful, diverse and diverse dimensions.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> on their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit little <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, so much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had been <unk> from these kids before?
But then I <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the year after the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but he avoided <unk> <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation to the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a boarding school, in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with lessons with music, and the children follow their games on on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, it described as disability to <unk> for life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, having them called them their little teachers, and he took to help in the development of education methods that were particularly appropriate for them.
<unk> saw autism as a huge continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop-up culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was more there until I mean, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that <unk> diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and Asperger model.
These changes didn't fell into <unk> <unk>
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked on each other to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autistic adult adult <unk>
Before it came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers all over the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were hoping that it were, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and the services that are <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blaming the vaccine by the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful simple story, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center of one of 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined on the Internet to refuse the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit <unk>
Indeed, people are autistic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still making <unk> that creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we <unk> into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a <unk>
Thank you.
