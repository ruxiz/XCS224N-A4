So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps more stressful things than when you're facing a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care, or one to be loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talking about a very particular medical condition.
But this is kind of <unk> as a <unk> for all of their medical decisions, and in fact for the source of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from one that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So let's suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the outcome of the lab and your cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, is a statistic that you should ask for that most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to get to a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood the mechanisms.
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most broadly <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before they can help an person?
300.
This is the research of the researchers who were cynical <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I myself explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid a heart attack, stroke brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects, Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include <unk> and you have muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, "The Five percent is not very likely to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think about clarity.
So think of how you can look at this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 have a side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say they should not be <unk>
I'm just saying that you must have this conversation with your physician.
The medical ethic. It requires, is part of the informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to initiate a conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the crash, but actually this number you need to try is pretty typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the top of the top of the top of the prostate cancer, the number of cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the time the questions that you can argue that you would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to do all this on the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain into the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predatory face, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react to fast.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown them.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> can be able to put systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of the <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door to the door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't talked about, and lots of message messages that I haven't read with.
So I'm not very organized, but I see organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may not be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my definition today of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, they mixed together with local signs, and we developed the language we today know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sense of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, following a foreign country, just following their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk>
So how does the sound understand you?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I learned, for example ...
"I don't know <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you don't have the <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In the culture, movement is the equivalent of sound.
This is the sign to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do my thumb with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why in my drawings I have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic board there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that they had taught me as a sound, decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose it to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support myself as well and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in the school, in the work and institutions and institutions, work with many different performers in <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
It helps me to be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value -- something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to put it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic media, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for you to get better how <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide up in many different <unk>
If you <unk> a very different <unk> for every finger while the piano, like facial expression, the facial expression, the body's movement, the speed, the shape of the hand, and so while the piano, the English piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get a button at a time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the place to express a concept of course or idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens to music in terms of pitch and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
Almost, oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and joined it.
This is <unk> Day."
If you get it, and you put it up, the visually speed, you see how a piece of music looks like.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> tonight."
All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  I will go tonight."
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, and we will have to go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically -- I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in the head and the chest -- but they carry very different meanings together.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, we live in a very strong world.
And just because <unk> has no sounds, it doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn to <unk> You don't have to hear music.
<unk> is a rich treasure. and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> you open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You know, you would hear everything, but then you have to <unk>
Information involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble from innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults too, and they are not very good to clean up the others.
Last time, I'm now adult and <unk> and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans are actually plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and put this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We start building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will say, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting plastic bits -- just providing information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids are very excited about robots.
Then we quickly created what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light bulbs and camera cameras on gods and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will get it even further.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good boys.
You see the news, you see the Internet, and you get bored with this image: right?
A child, maybe under 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands of <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink, is the water that you would get to the water where you get the place where you live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is also the brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> <unk> which can help you identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help make remote other children.
I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to tackle a harder problem, and closer to me.
I am half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> crops -- several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people were killed in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station close to water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons of still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean.
If we go on the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and most of the time, has a safe thing, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research that with other scientists, the land, the river and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we reported to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take the serious work, but they did, because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their lives.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a map of <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the powder dust, <unk> from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition at the nearest nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen of fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking tracking of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even started to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should go and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so much so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and converted it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, <unk> basically, you can build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adult help, and where adults can be the kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or well, we can help in mobility -- the advanced population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic and the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrific truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes -- two culture of radically <unk>
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the silk.
One of them is synthetic the other stuff.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thought it believed.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But life is not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that is required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects, as <unk> of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skin are thin with <unk> light-activated pores
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other primarily as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, it shows on the two screens after me.
My job on its most simple level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, exploding from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where they have four disciplines that offers access to access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believed them.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis, that someday not very far to print up and print buildings at the nanoscale <unk> and graphs at the nanoscale made of <unk> genetically engineered buildings that shine into the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> is the unique size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator of 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CAT scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments of allowing us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic <unk> a chair to the harsh <unk> and also it makes sound sound.
Professor Carter set up to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Your surface, like in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to other material or other <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and actually defined a lot of what it matters.
Like she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, twigs, sheets and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees to grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask, "What would the design be if objects were made from a single <unk>
<unk> to a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material <unk> the kind of material from the tree of tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second biggest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year for organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in to the <unk> of the <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> sexual concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, <unk> and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material -- a half feet long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, you can dry it up to find a natural shape in touch with the air.
So why do we keep designing <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which first showed up on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without the <unk> <unk> and if it goes even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure that is made from shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed in the ground, will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the <unk> we did our own table of items, and new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops as well.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
A converts light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the <unk> tract that will help you bring these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk> functionality as well.
If we wanted more <unk> they will get more transparent channels.
This digestive system, <unk> when it stretches from one end to another covered 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our gut intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do that, you always need to go back to nature.
And so you know what a 3D printer is in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
A acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by connecting those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm was on the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, putting the silk worm in a flat patch and not within a box, we realized that they would have a lightweight, flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the shape -- the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly through the environment.
Often they <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it uses the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the sacred <unk> without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making <unk> silk, and we put us on our site.
We knew that spider silk worms into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and the heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and the heat and the silk worms of the structure.
We were ready to receive <unk>
We were asking <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to marry us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> and they got eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
<unk> silk about silk, <unk> silk -- they give all this pavilion for the whole pavilion for us.
And in a bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full gap.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by the design inspired by us, for the first time, that we make in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time of this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Five. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and developed web sites. And he would play the guitar on a musical band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I usually like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something totally different, and I would get involved in it, and I'm going to get <unk> and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern brought me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and bring them to <unk>
Another reason that I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me is not going to be <unk> at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I would like to ask me then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you know about the culture.
"What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that no one cares about what you would go to that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question comes to us and again as you grow in various ways as you go in various high school students, you get to the high school students, ask you to go to the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the dream.
Why?
While this question is inspired by kids to dream about what they might be, it's not inspired to dream of all that they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults do well <unk> and say, "Oh, how good, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You've got to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> and <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they have to choose to.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny or the real vocation, the idea that each one of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that they want to do?
There's no place to someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, so to say.
It could help you divide it into three parts: myeloma, <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can do, the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own one of your own.
It looks like a kind of <unk> to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like <unk> or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
There are three superpowers out there.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in about data visualization.
<unk> is a company that creates a inspired jewelry company.
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
You come from the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all its background, they can access a lot of these points in the intersection.
The second superpower superpower is learning quickly.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we're going to go.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try and test new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we have learned to every new zone that we have -- so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and independent writer <unk>
As a Polish pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before becoming a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when they were starting their practices and this ability to help him write compelling moments for the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to go to what you can do, even if you finally get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other from websites -- sometimes consultant on Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles depending on the needs of customers.
<unk> Company magazine, defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can be able to <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they're in your heart <unk>
Knowing the belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put ideas, and <unk> provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected.
And, unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part they were told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope that's this: <unk> with the wiring -- <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep her curious about those <unk> <unk>
Take the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a most authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world are <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> they took her to a psychiatric psychiatric
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until he unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
What's even more surprising.
If you had to have been living today, we could not give her more help than the one that he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has gone a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer for cancer, <unk> for HIV, for <unk> and much more.
But little has been progress on Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's percent for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's disease is almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their <unk> or helping to take care of a friend or want to care with Alzheimer's disease.
In the United States, Alzheimer's percent costs cost 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
The most expensive disease today is the most expensive disease and its costs in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk> to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists even, the scientists with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know today that they're made from protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds out as a origami.
There are places in paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these points will end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are going down on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that it goes into and then create a drug that is done.
Until recently, most of them have been reduced to the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and we were <unk> physical chemicals and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now you're testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick to each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they were going to go and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result: but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to get that hope of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments and drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment at the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the western New York Times in January of this year.
To love someone, you do this.
The article is about a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when we test it in the past one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers will be <unk> to be 36 more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about it or it -- I know very honest this time, and I gave you things that you don't say to someone you've just known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me and the gossip that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be expected to <unk>
However, we got to us, and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spinal cord a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's August of August, so I guess some of you probably wonder, keep together <unk>
And the reason I think I'm challenging this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was published the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had emailed me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and that was usually just my Facebook friends and I imagined that my paper in the New York Times would be probably about thousands of them.
And that brought a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But we had no idea.
The article was released on a Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received more than eight million <unk> and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is foster trust writing successfully on their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that life love with an international news has been to -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always were doing the same question: still keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
A number of messages appear immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and weird <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately went red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on an international opportunity, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> your own life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when they test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to each request that we both did a public rise together.
<unk> TV interviews, and refused to orders them from pictures of two.
I think it was afraid of becoming the icons of <unk> of the process of <unk> a range of which I didn't feel at all about it.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether they really do, and I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love not just an adventure, but love love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was no, it would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the research goal was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal focus, between university students, using what we were doing, called <unk> personal and <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
Participants were closer to the participants after doing that, several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol as a way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of the police and the community and the community of <unk> <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little college university university and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say that you would sell you from the person who you would <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had that relationship since I had 20, what I was mostly supposed to do all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or could I live without it.
So I went to the science.
And so I did all of what I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could somehow get the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just did for the book I was writing about, in retrospect, it seems really like <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel that bad and I used to sit then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what you get.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for, is sometimes more than reasonably reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that there may be a short cut for <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate something about the risk of risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still still together?
And their content with an answer from yes or No.
So more than a question, I would propose to make more difficult questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserve your love and who doesn't it?
How do you stay in love in love when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago -- a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep us together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk>
<unk> fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to do.
I didn't consider how many times you would have both of them to make that decision, and how much would you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not.
I want you to be enough to have made and responded 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what I <unk> and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to really happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is a chance to choose someone, and the hope that he also loved to me, and it's scary -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and I sort of got a <unk> of the forest.
I actually hit the city of New York ago -- something that really affected me but more details later.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and they <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a feather and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat them.
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and <unk> and all these things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style -- Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: in some way it seemed to grow up size, as if it was going to be able to get the text to a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, which I started to add strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God mine can draw in space.
I can actually flow <unk> just like you do about a body on the crime scene.
And I took objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals -- <unk>
First of all, you will be able to make an idea.
Then I did some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was gaining some money, so I would bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, <unk> of natural sizes with drawings of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I would get it.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing in a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that were a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a great measure in "The garden. <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left is Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals are between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide -- mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the bin bin Laden, there are all weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
It's also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is coming out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, like a bird, and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of <unk> a tail of <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail got fire on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go out, you know.
His tail ends up in a eye of <unk> made from terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
It's about a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they're <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that's 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside it.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the chest. He's your chest, you know, the <unk>
I'm going to see you all over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these work because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a body game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that go out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician a musician a writer, a writer, a writer, a <unk> a museum, a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
And the box and all the people from inside strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you die, who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweet things, we are all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your mind?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have a effect on pain, first goes through your stomach, your bowels and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug will be able to be able to make it in your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> these serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the neurological cells count.
But they are also known for their side effects of side effects on their negative, because in the time it takes it to get to the current current, you get <unk> and worse even for the time it takes it to your fate, which is where it takes to be more important, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the metastatic <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it can't easily come into the bloodstream of the patients that are tested to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a <unk> treatment for oral life.
One day, I sat down and I thought, "Let me get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you are used in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can use it for anything <unk> including transportation transportation of drugs.
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce drug medications.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
So we sent a little strong beam of laser on the cellular membrane living with HIV as these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro vitro technology, and the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, applying it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first brain, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to go to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which is <unk> it releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these forces of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to non-violent <unk>
I do job work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a social services network and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian players known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting.
They're multitasking they're multitasking
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations -- radio channels, TV channels, online websites and strategies in social networks.
And here they have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex hedge of funds without <unk> but through <unk> business for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> provides all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering us something that the state is not for security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped through the war or even the principle of <unk> <unk> can also be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, they provide social services that means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in Texas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at groups of <unk> we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps in the government, and they come up with armed groups, political groups, involved in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and most sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a landscape, run all its <unk> collect the trash running the <unk> system.
It's a state. It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations and hybrids, and the more weak they are in the states, as in the Middle East today, and they fill that gap and not the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to be investing more in the military tools.
You know, that field of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we can better understand groups that will understand what to offer better what to offer the transition from violence to violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, the military power can win some <unk> but not give us peace and stability.
To get these targets we need long-term investments to fill that gap of security, to fill that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I am a failure as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept that <unk> label would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but quite bad.
And so I was very excited about it as a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> with men and who hated sex. Like if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who are asking too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's like superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that female <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it would be free or violence.
We have a right to use easy way and accessible to control and services and services ...
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to realize our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender expression and religion and social condition and skills and so much more.
We have to have to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
To me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another <unk>
When I lead to work, listen to music, rap music at all volume.
Although the letter degrades to women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang is incredible.
Do you actually have your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical ideas.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> fantasies of <unk> fairy tales that become reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in the house to raise their children, they would sell that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through these same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
You know, whatever emotion has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the <unk> gay and <unk> in favor of white women, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist problem.
It also happens to this: Like <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to make it seamlessly.
When we <unk> we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders in the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear of what that tag means for fear is not to be able to fulfill the little realistic expectations.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist feminist in the last years.
At the Video: Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> work in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star from <unk> to embrace it openly feminism and make to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began with endless arguments if we were able to deal with it or not feminist.
He was taking their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to protect the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad humor, or much more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give up, pass it into action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a supply limitless.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change effectively affecting their profit.
It's really hard.
Why does her music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad choices take justify that it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
They get rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is going to be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go into the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, to participate in their project, to participate in your project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to <unk> it to be even more like us, even more like us, to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we are not pure, <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small functions of bravery and expect our choices to get to the top, to people in the power of directors, and producers of music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more brave and significant change.
We can also tell with courage -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
Some of the kids were going to tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all of it didn't bother to believe it might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and intellect, I also discovered that if it was a little courageous woman, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I have the grim truth that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, I don't abandon everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little brave when you need to be able to be able to <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> kids in California had <unk> to have looked at <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border to Canada, <unk> more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily treatable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something was supposed to be still <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked for being a <unk> fraud for the British Medical Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world continue to <unk> that vaccines are still going to be able to put their kids from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> who had heard about it creates all their professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates kept stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could catch another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a <unk> detection <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how he discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> from Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients that looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces, but they were prey from panic to <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual location without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the years of 1950, as the leading authority of the world in the subject, I stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as we were making references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, I'll give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine percent of every 10 children sent from other doctors to their doctor's office without giving a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by a cold parent and <unk>
These kids, they said, they have stayed carefully at a refrigerator than they didn't know.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had some special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 hours before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite albums he said, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were just going to know what they had heard of their parents -- desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it was not until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of mentor mothers were pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm, warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as they have no services, no special education, no special education, not access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand in front of the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years earlier.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
He took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw -- let me clear that the <unk> model was too narrow, because the autism reality was much more <unk> and diverse as well.
Some children could not speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination in their fascination in the dinosaurs or the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in cute <unk> and <unk> as he said, <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did nobody have been <unk> of these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in their own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was running a integrated clinical clinic in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children who were <unk> were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, with music, and kids followed their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> having seen autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in known as the known and the social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even until to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the diagnostic criteria that <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 80 and early changes in the '90s, their changes enter into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk> <unk>
These changes don't fell into broken it.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked together to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it was coming out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts I know what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition, and parents around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first time clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
It no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that the other with autism and their families would finally support the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise in the <unk> and a powerful story, and <unk> credible story as bad as <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart rate that one in the United States are in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic is one of the world's biggest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea of the puzzles that are the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of operating operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> but it suffers from a attention deficit <unk>
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of the teachers, employers who are able to support, employers of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in covered with <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
