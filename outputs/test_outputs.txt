You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, the most read in America.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> <unk> or <unk> and no one has ever chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an <unk> is generally something that you fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle of the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to bleed every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, and he ended up in San Francisco, California, I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to begin to work in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> we have never come to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man who I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to stick with it, please."
Well, the next day, we were in <unk>
And we went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found it a place, and the <unk> and we care about her family, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was necessary, because I was
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he became a box of cinders and he was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that <unk> that I talked about it was present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her from her.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that this was a snowflake on another snowflake year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or you break off the ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse and <unk> and <unk> to the end, while others cannot <unk> it more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and they, in large as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing up its ancestral atmosphere.
As a B15 iceberg releases the rich freshwater rich in minerals that feeds so many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, to know that in these unique moments exist in that way, and will not be there and won't be there again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> it's a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to get really to witness a B15 iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved towards the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a B15 iceberg with the average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the B15 side shows a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about understanding itself, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> <unk> joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the sperm X of the sperm joins up to the X chromosome.
They both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my heart activity I turned two roles.
In one of my roles I work with romantic history.
I'm a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way people started the anatomy -- and of human bodies and <unk> how they have looked at the body body, the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role as performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> from people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with <unk> twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> is not fit into male schemes, and conventional <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that is not <unk> in the common shapes or <unk>
For example, this is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> the chromosome -- and it says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes make testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't respond to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone and without reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a course typically <unk>
When you <unk> the baby looks like a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realized that instead of <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women as I -- I -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think, to be a typical woman most of the women as I am sensitive to <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as a <unk> he had his girlfriend, he was wearing a life like a boy and she had just found that he had <unk> and womb.
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had <unk> <unk> and in the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone <unk>
As a consequence, the <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is that they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> they're being tested with <unk> surgeries that is not to be able to have a better physical health better.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they are dealing with several surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity -- <unk> <unk> means to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
Very simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in a same body.
The highest recent case is last year with <unk> South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> their sex in the Olympic <unk>
Many journalists called the question, "What do you test to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to the reporters that there's no such test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these kinds of <unk> were thought of were <unk> <unk> categories, directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something which is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What <unk> from the fact of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories, which are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which one body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved it away, I still don't know.
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining really somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories, of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
<unk> from the concept of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical, in what they did, that I find myself every little bit looking at that music, <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> -- for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as all of you remember what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world did not know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that it was coming into the political power of the blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and they replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> the science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
Don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They speak about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future of <unk> <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people from color that we <unk> the <unk> coincidence about the <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should hear the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the age of five years should be allowed to have sex relationships or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me makes sense and I think we should <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, <unk> was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born at the contrary, was born on March 1 of March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before that Mary was attributed to all three months before Henry -- three months before Henry -- sexual consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it is <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on his hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories, which in many aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy of <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of kind of like, <unk> <unk> "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosome, and to marry a woman you have to have <unk> chromosome.
Now, practice does not make tests <unk> people.
But this is also very strange to tell the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
He says we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to take it to <unk> rights to people, because I've to admit that I know about some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent intelligent decisions, smart and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 than I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking about the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for instance, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be <unk> unless you are willing to be willing to be willing to stand for a change of sex in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had done a few years ago that I had done a few years ago and then pick them up, and so they <unk> her name.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the <unk> operation, a very <unk> operation told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he's considered the political <unk> instead of <unk>
The U.S. offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> and that's that I think you can have different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate student, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I thought I was interested as a <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
What are the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to get rid of the gender <unk> so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I think about the question, the more I think there is something feminine in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect people for part of the state, it's possible that there are more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we raise democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking about where it wants to go live and work, have the chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment, we're far from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell with one city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than its building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just replaced by the apartments.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are the owners and the other half still <unk> to do that.
You could try to increase the capacity by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid <unk> and <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place to build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place would be built to build it instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that governments to <unk> new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
Later I learned later that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> <unk> their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next election <unk> <unk> <unk> imposed on a platform in which <unk> promised and the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say they cannot go and choose all the current residents to apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes too much of technologies to <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
On the fall of 2010, a <unk> friend sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covered over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about the less 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were really serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option in a city that could go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away towards the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with the countries associated with and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could easily cover a thousand square miles.
And shortly after January, the 19th of January, you voted in Congress to <unk> her Constitution and to add a constitutional arrangement that allowed these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis in Congress for this constitutional constitutional question, it was from <unk> to one.
All of the parties are all <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed another time in another voting -- <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of 21, the 21 to <unk> from about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that is building in Korea -- is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> to <unk> and they would allow the <unk> to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last <unk> court for this new justice system.
There are urban and <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that want to move into the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's one million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back their family to go back to their family to get a job job, sometimes they have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it is that I live obsessed with the outfits.
I love to find, and dress, and more recently, to photograph and publish my blog and colorful <unk> suits for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My guess is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my <unk>
I would like color <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of <unk> and nothing else.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else that I wanted to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know what the woman is walking on for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, <unk> or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal amount of 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the boy that you're wearing in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal universal truth for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal way, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
So obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I am going to give it all right.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally <unk> for these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another kind of crazy suit, colorful and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you put a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For instance, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where's your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they are mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I think of myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need quite a bit of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed with the passage of the years is that it says one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you're not born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet you play with that space bar taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to stay in one place.
This is a very big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking <unk> they play with these little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all sorts of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that are surrounding us every day.
That's not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But you don't get good to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow up in the early mechanics principles.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap in an overlap in quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand it a little bit -- it's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal little bit of metal, a way of springboard and that are <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started running all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when another people goes up, I'm going to leave you with doing those things, because I don't want to bother you, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey on objects of inanimate objects are not only people, it is also the light that happens to the <unk> and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to throw out all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then it <unk> it at a temperature of less than one degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the tiny piece of metal is free to act like that.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was <unk> and the way I <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that I don't <unk> at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal is still still yet, and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means that the whole metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that metal little bit is roughly the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in the space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights into the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all of the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my <unk> that's here and allowed me to do this.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, we were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not <unk> me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we form a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better to show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So let me go to <unk>
Look around every museum there.
There's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the <unk> and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the regions.
And then keep going. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's the whole information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click on, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you can actually get with 10,000 billion <unk>
It can zoom in into it very simple.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, this seems <unk>
And I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is hitting a <unk> with a stick on <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to get deeper and you can see that you can actually get even into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online your own museum, create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The Power of <unk> -- we just made a <unk>
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, I send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk> work.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my view, you even don't come from <unk>
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment, do justice to its work of art, and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that makes me today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of her bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting about <unk> careers -- one in the last two decades.
Now, there was some time, if you wanted to win a <unk> career. One, I would take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, and control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronic electronics.
They're becoming free <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition for <unk> <unk> at MoMA, at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms come back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction as humans we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> it says that at the end of the <unk> he said to the <unk> -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you only about <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the things -- I played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day is watching the activity <unk>
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before play.
The time line is on the top.
In the evening early people are here and there are doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people do a quick call on the bathroom.
Second <unk> End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She runs Italy, <unk>
That night everybody went to <unk>
You see the big <unk>
The next day, everybody went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister of time.
And then everybody lower the world.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the spike at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things we use and consume things.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a <unk> how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are going on.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the crap in its change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that before not existed.
There are complicated things happening and there's lots of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that we <unk> it didn't have yet somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> one day still there.
What if we show people, then we can promote some change in <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about, at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology <unk> the new technology, you join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk>
He believed like a water <unk> with the pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write in them, I'll show patterns, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
I liked a lot of it.
And we <unk> a commission to design the building to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There's no windows and no windows -- but when you're approaching it so you can get it to you.
The ceiling is also coated with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> they want to minimize the ceiling.
Or you can close the building, and the entire architecture is lost, like this.
And those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it <unk> but when it's almost almost the entire architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the people <unk> so it's inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was actually even more funny.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way you interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and water holes and you had to jump up to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because the architects, engineers, designers, we always think of how people will give our designs.
But then it's always always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to prove that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
Sort of a flexible screen, like this with a normal <unk> configuration.
Or, in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights off, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them being controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's both digitization of 3D digitization in real time motion capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make all of them <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've made everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, power world, the power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do we go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people have involved in doing this together together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from the pixels of the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will be to share the main moments of the Olympic Olympics, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of heaven as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
Like a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody that goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only a lot of changes in your genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate and more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better ways, be stronger and more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure ourselves?
How about to live with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably got to the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk> <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of them -- that makes me feel good as a medical doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just imagination?
Or maybe even possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor about the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense to light from <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution -- consider this: it's only about the past, or the future?
Does the other or <unk>
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the most interest of us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids.
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, which is going out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all lead into the little more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> tells you what <unk> think of <unk>
The gut is an wonderfully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide you all the nutrients that can want to be <unk>
It's really like a rapid pathway for bacteria with occasional <unk> <unk> <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help us digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
We're in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms every cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two island cells.
But when the organisms show up, things start to change.
The sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body enters evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed quite reasonable at the time, but with every year he was going on, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Vegas well in its 90 years.
And one night somebody hits your hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, you find a little <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, says, George, I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy <unk>
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as a <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think they all <unk> the feeling that put <unk> <unk> when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily make longevity.
It doesn't necessarily threaten the biggest or the stronger or at the faster and even more clever.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to its environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there would be fish there, fish <unk> in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution -- and in particular, if we look forward, at the <unk> phase I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation of evolution.
A second possibility is that you create a evolution of the traditional type, natural type, by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the species -- distant planets are going to exist, the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, a more intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution that is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
You first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make the genetic changes to get rid of diabetes or Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating it.
You don't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and he was 13.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of doing that, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
Not much to make it a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and be increasingly <unk>
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they are going to be <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> cells in a tobacco plant cells.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little <unk>
Can you change the cells of their bodies but and if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and <unk> them or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of <unk> Ken <unk> especially if you could fill it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices for a better better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for anyone else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom that we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So he immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
We <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes, I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we died -- these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the <unk> the bridge -- George Washington -- which was not for a lot -- I thought I really -- <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, it also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that we were doing things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to get rid of the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to be <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die isn't scared.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a small guy.
And for me, that was all reason to be in the world.
At that point, I get to connect these two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the chance to look at the future and go back and live in a different way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine on your plane -- and please don't be that -- but you imagine, how do you <unk>
What is it that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today <unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company, and I have an animation company, so of course, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he can communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are important and have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody seen the film "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way. They're going to make the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can I be?"
So I introduced myself to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with her brother and her father there at that very precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw about that and record the negative space.
So they go around by making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
You start with the <unk> organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life on his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving the things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that we could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, really <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world of all the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved into the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid, and that when they were older, they would have taken out the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> and my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of glasses of cheap sun that we buy on the <unk> <unk> <unk> some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, and we put it together on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- -- -- -- and it builds the <unk> <unk> the software is low in a way for free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then over a year of planning two weeks of programming at the early night, Tony Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran off the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall on the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing his family and friends -- and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and he would take me out of there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> bubble.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> <unk> in the center of Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of the thing that there is in this room was possible -- the <unk> the microphone, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> anything was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I did nothing with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are generally very difficult and at the same time so dangerous.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in hot <unk> <unk> <unk> areas.
And I spent 30 days by eating just this fun -- a difficult thing in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in similar situations with the only goal to treat. Look at social issues in ways that make <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that will be <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple weeks ago, I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TED Talk.
What was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when I do it.
But that is a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title for progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to tell me with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something that could be so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that tries to deal with <unk> products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom at the end, has <unk> images, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title was the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X for the title, but we're going to make sure that we are going to destroy all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you <unk> a shoe and the most great shoe you ever <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The largest movie ever <unk> the best <unk> you know, <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk>
The whole goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all he shot -- from beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear you -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive is going to be people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk>
MS: A million and a half million a half and a half million <unk> -- I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting of them, but definitely it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that movie comes out as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be difficult for <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have a few places to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought I <unk> the <unk> it meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today that this intersection of new media and old media and the scenario of the separate media is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle is worth getting the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
It wasn't really a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image represents image.
See, when you look for <unk> images on Google <unk>   This is one of the first pictures that showed up.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president -- even the CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to making it something really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives you <unk>  like that weird bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk> path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's pretty risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want it to make a story, but they <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and that's what he looked at as a <unk> said, "Son, there are <unk> there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real-time story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away the <unk> and go to the businesses myself with all my team.
So what I started to see is -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant films and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make large Hollywood movies say that the reason that their movies have so much successful has to be on the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make films films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically in the film?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you with you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We are going to have so much for man to be <unk> <unk> on bar, like that.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a little <unk>
<unk> to the kind of smaller movies that <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have any other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people <unk> people are the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: technologies.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you happy.
How do we keep them fresh, with better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about me?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to the people like me, <unk> <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, many gray and things like that.
Usually I wear a toilet sunglasses, or the <unk> of the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand like a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly partly <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the <unk>
<unk> toys for pets on the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little <unk> that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because they <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Go! <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be <unk> but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone to go into my head, someone who could help me understand what the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and in my case come come and start in the West West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next thing is, this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me of the <unk> to what do you do that?
What is the <unk> How do you phase <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important to <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be scared.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of <unk> all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> Morgan Morgan -- is a <unk> brand.
They <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be <unk> in one of your strong points or in the other time of focusing on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's the nature of <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> by the fear of fear, these items, and you actually give them a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What are other brands like this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there's <unk> marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to hold your <unk> identity, what would that be?
You're a <unk> You are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more well a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are <unk> stable, family <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
And over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and for <unk>
We went to San Paulo where you've been forbidden the advertising open.
All over the city over the last five years there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to districts that companies are getting on the way in schools with available available available schools.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or that I've been more successful in the ones that I've <unk> with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> they took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about how people are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has it gone? They did <unk>
Well, since the film was released in <unk> <unk> let's look at a look.
According to <unk> the film was behind in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we have had 900 million media impressions for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not on the line. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talk about is telling their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you get <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people of that is pushing the failure.
I think that when you train their employees at risk averse to the risk of the risk of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we will move forward, I think we need to be afraid of fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And said that, with honesty and transparency, all my <unk> <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So <unk> on behalf of the transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED from next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software are a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the <unk> nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started to research on <unk> it was six months ago, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> as a rat rat didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking for the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect it is actually working in that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we discovered that I was <unk> in two bombs and a little bit of a big one.
We also saw that they were armed very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all points for those to attack.
You probably even know how much people are going to get back the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard the <unk> <unk> it's complex, and <unk> let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code here.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at initially was called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we were trying to <unk> with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories of goals -- we remember that an violent, <unk> must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They are not several of these targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants among our <unk>
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to return to <unk> engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called steps.
And guess what do we find in the <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had with each other.
And so that there is no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been to be taken after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that the two digital digital <unk> would look at one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have given the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about other goals to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There is the gray box and the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input values of sensors for example, from pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code -- which is still running over the attack, with <unk> <unk>
And believe it or not, this <unk> input is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's <unk> <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open <unk> valves.
Obviously, this can't do a human operator,
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And no <unk> no security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is a <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this payload with a key key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology.
<unk> as possible.
And if you <unk> that, with what you do, it's a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets are not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with great goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and we better start making it now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public <unk> in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind it.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give them <unk> skills or another one that will make users of the wheelchair and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is in addition to your speed, and help you, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take on their back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to carry even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- lesions in the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage on the back.
We decided to explore this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton exoskeleton -- I can give you 90 pounds of rough land for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I want my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
So it's a reality.
So now I look back towards the users of the wheels, so I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the entire population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or another <unk> -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> who's using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago he had an injury in the column, and as a result, it couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
Not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There's also a couple of batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move along with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all the feeling and all the <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you'll never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
I stole even the last bit of the hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the <unk> we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but specifically and all the users of the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know the cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with the chimps, with the chimps, their closest living parents.
That means that we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary <unk> which lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost as many as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> <unk> and deforestation do that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not not sure about it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos you can hear the hidden laughter of the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes as <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is critical to create bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots -- very much of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual of it.
The game is the glue that comes us together.
I don't know how you play yourself, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken out of the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> has <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like her, we sometimes play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos are giving us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But do it <unk> our <unk> capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent ones.
So fellow primates, for that, to embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they will, creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires like the captain of the captain of a fire firemen volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are <unk> a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But there was still a career against the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain and figure out what our homework.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that was definitely crossing one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before I was, <unk> <unk> <unk>  And he came up to the captain and he asked her to come up and <unk> the owner of the owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a building in a call to save a living building just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a couple of shoes."
We <unk> it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, he went to the firemen in the end of that height and less than they had ended up with the fire and entered the main room looking for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load around the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We took out of the house the treasures for the home owner of the home where, as they would expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> owner by the brave <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was someone had reached a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as <unk> I am a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room and people who have achieved, or are you for doing that, I would like to remind you of this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something for <unk> <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining hall, a <unk> park.
be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So I trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete is built in <unk> with a very simple idea, of cement modules from a fixed measure of cement in each other.
Very quickly, these became the most widely used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges -- a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
It was called the <unk> of <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful <unk> buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick and piled around a world where everything was interactive.
Like the block of particular, the transistor allows you to create a much bigger circuits and more complex -- a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together by magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly start to make older circuits.
A blue guy with a green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and then we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having a program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or <unk> it just turns out this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to move into building blocks ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how do you work a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how a iPod responds to touch.
We've taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, the designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers of the School <unk> School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, an <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to the reach of everyone.
And so, <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking for the environment to be involved with the <unk>
It's the distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
Can you take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to be able to leave the video on a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm already <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending it to the Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They made big <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant <unk>
Here it appears as if I would look for a quote, but what you really find is that somebody else is caught by the snow, because he knows it's not very good at turning off fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- just last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of Erik <unk> noticed something else else: that citizens <unk> with shovels the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
By doing so, you put a name, in this case he <unk> him.
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, you have a component playground.
It's a modest app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of government <unk>
And it goes viral.
A responsible way in <unk> City, looking at this application realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to adopt the <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> batteries.
That's why I asked citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has spread without <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen.
<unk> acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then we were told that they had made the normal channels would have taken at least two years and four million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that up to the moment -- 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that you program program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the government to government, not like in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
That is, without <unk> in form and open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a big frustration before that, but they didn't get <unk> <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they put crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> us -- remember that <unk> <unk> the way it would think about it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is, above all, a matter of <unk>
This is the heart care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I didn't find any.
And then he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the home, put it very strong and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So please.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and <unk> called <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the <unk> Office of Boston.
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I approached the place, found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to the distributed <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as well.
And I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological technology.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to the two people.
And you might have connected to government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper and cheaper than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, <unk> the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have I chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values and really <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface surface of 15 feet.
So underneath is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us that really belongs to us, that we funded as something that operates in ours that other other thing, and as a result, we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've got <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> activism.
And so for those of us that have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that they are going to face.
Do you really believe that we will go where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so difficult to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members of the age of 28 years, so I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost a granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
You can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care about doing hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They put their hands into the work to program applications that will work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have <unk> those <unk> and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government who we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until not <unk> the citizenship.
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row, death.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional African-American house dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in the whole of the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, I looked at me and I looked at me and give me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then I was shocked.
One or two hours later, I would go back and say, <unk> I would still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would love me again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that makes you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins running out.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and she looked at it, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up through the room, and he took me out of the hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> We are <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget that.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't know it. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And I said, "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you like."
I'll never forget that.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing, even the right thing to be <unk>
I thought I was thinking, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South <unk> I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and to me, and we went to the forest.
We just just do <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as us.
I took something, your sister as well. Take a <unk>
I said, "No. I didn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I just nailed it to force and <unk> "Oh, not be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I'm 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that the identity has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense of it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the biggest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor or black communities, you find so much <unk> so <unk> which is given by these facts.
One of three black three and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In <unk> urban <unk> in the entire country, Los <unk> Philadelphia, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in the color of color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of the race -- it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And we seem to be very <unk>
The policy of fear and <unk> make us believe that these are not a problem.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some of the things that are well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you have a <unk> <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male has ever lost the right to vote.
And if we <unk> it over the next 10 years, the level of rights will be as high as it was before they <unk> law enforcement to vote.
We have this remarkable silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world that was <unk> to die in prison.
We have this country prison for children, without any chance to go away.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty in America is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent man who is innocent and released from death <unk>
An innocent <unk> <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly to fly if every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say, <unk> people who stop saying that in our story, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time will come to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you want.
We don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room stood in silence and a lady said, "There is no way with our history, we can ever get to get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to be irrational and <unk> and we would put people to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel like in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We could not be <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these things as difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are, but we <unk>
We love innovation.
It's fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that they will never come to TED.
And thinking about them it is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so <unk>
With innovation, with creativity. And development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that are <unk> also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in place of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is almost in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allowed us to be really human beings if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege to be a young lawyer to know Rosa <unk>
These women were all together, just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady was called <unk> to me, <unk> comes the Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. Yes I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And one occasion was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got his finger on her face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst we have to do.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful people, but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my 13 <unk> and I see my 13 years old, which have been <unk> to be told as adults as adults do.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge ever turn someone in what is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late was <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, should have the magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a tiny, black hole.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my <unk> <unk> was treated as a <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there have been <unk> conduct in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only have <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case for this case.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. I went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> it was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When I saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He's <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
And then I got <unk> and I was <unk>
And I was <unk> in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply to my interior, with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I walked into the <unk>
When he walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started halfway through.
People started getting there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All of all, because we were talking about <unk> because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I reached to see the <unk> that went and <unk>
I would look at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black man walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, <unk> judge is a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up towards justice.
We cannot be truly <unk> human beings if we don't care about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is bound to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire to the audience, of this community, to help in your own way, do something.
Which is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the California state, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort to <unk> the funds that are spent today in <unk> policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars worth of death, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law <unk>
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say that is this?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic rise in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> people to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've been excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months of months, could be in the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are receiving lots of more data than the brain probably can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So a <unk> stories of stories would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news -- seven days of a week, 24 hours per day, 24 hours per day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong in worse.
But maybe not.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> in such a way that we have the potential to create a <unk> world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems climate change, the extinction of species, the <unk> of water and <unk> no doubts that we have.
As human beings we are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we just end with them.
Let's take this thing in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income per capita is <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened 25 percent to more than 80 to 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to have higher expectations <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line, have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> <unk> <unk> air and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of <unk>
And so a lot of this is technology and lately, exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology, jumps into this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the performance of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things at this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and peace, in recession, of depression and <unk>
It's the very fast computers that used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop to any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in one law to the left, it's curve up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, which my <unk> friends call infinite computing and networks, and networks, 3D printing and <unk> the 3D printing and the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet -- synthetic biology, fuel fuels and food, digital medicine, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, from <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of your mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk>
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
Is it about taking that <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The <unk> troops ate with covered in <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the <unk> to Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
I would take this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in one year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about lean but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study showing that it shows that in the late decade, in the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have wealth abundance we also have <unk>
Let's talk about the wars in water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the spacecraft Voyager <unk> into Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a big picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small fridge
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of water from the day of any <unk> water, saltwater, water, <unk> by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought about it that will make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that we would be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than the president Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communication and communications that no one could have ever been.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video -- <unk> images, of books and music, <unk> <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when it comes up with health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device that they talk, and because it has <unk> they can <unk> you can get blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a <unk> team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> an RNA virus or DNA that doesn't <unk> to call the health <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the <unk> <unk>
By the way, the best protection of population explosion is to give to the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds before <unk> that you add to global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud, it will be more productive than ever before.
What can we get three billion members of <unk> healthy <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give the offspring wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and they could act for the first time?
What would these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that small teams -- guided by its passion with a goal of course, you can do things that were before they could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of us heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> control the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came around and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today the human recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take out of the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that it <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot of it until the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about the Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> still say they still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shifting of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a pond, in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 inch, the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made up over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to five centimeters <unk>
It <unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- we started in <unk> Europe did many development projects.
<unk> development meant to impose countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad -- he called the <unk> four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in the southern Sea Sea in China <unk> and, above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are blobs on a little bit about <unk> the remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the sea floor came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral <unk> in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a living.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
I <unk> the new level, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation of using the images, I have received the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the picture of changes.
And at the end of it to keep some <unk> <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they have done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very abundant before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a big loss.
Eventually, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
Over time, there's a few fish but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way -- it's not the way they would expect that they have evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a captain as a captain -- and then I watched a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can serve a protected area.
Because with the marine areas, we really recreated the past.
And we <unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been running and very low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Area.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do we <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I am Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are made of <unk> and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk>  <unk> <unk> When I was younger -- that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web makes any of us, or of our actions, and copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
It took over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the time, gets a lot of infinite visits and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of <unk> communities and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> on the popularity of the last summer.
He was not saying to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of the <unk>
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> I published this tweet that I <unk> the video to the <unk>
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> presented us and present things new and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, <unk> you have to start on a Friday.   You all want to get the end of a week --  --  --  --                  <unk> on a Friday. I put on the Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think that we could have this conversation without
<unk> of Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, at Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took the <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends takes a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great <unk> joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, unlike the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's that, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an ancient version.
And then international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video for minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> to <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you from running properly through the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to have five million watched and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all new things that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities of participation, which is completely unexpected, they're characteristics of a new kind of media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I'm not asking for permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's hardly the current media, but we can have the future of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only of the single unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> enter <unk> facing the fact that their life had been completely in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now <unk>
It's <unk> in silence.
They died <unk>
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but <unk> it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn, <unk> <unk> to sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was destined to be a <unk> task, the escape from her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> he defies fiction, a boat slid into the sea of <unk> <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> <unk> in every single <unk> and the vast horizon and <unk>
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much, and the first apple that I tried to, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations -- shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is comprised of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that they came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, two turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what they should be <unk> that was usually <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs of half for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until the nightmares of the <unk> to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't make <unk> angry and <unk> boys were trapped between two worlds.
They went subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless with what I would <unk>
On the other one, I was <unk> in life <unk> tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer and I was elected the young Australian man in the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its <unk> <unk>
As <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak on sites that had never heard <unk> and in homes whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a mother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and he <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we get to the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
And the more I did talk about it was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the paths of life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living on the border.
And even though I finished my artwork I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
I had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown one, new on the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, perhaps a gift of ship.
Because it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a kind of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They were going to be a small group of people who the slogan cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot pot that all <unk>
<unk> to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we open up by step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
And then one trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before you finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 it became <unk> from a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of their husband, he had an <unk> to <unk> and carry the cause off, and much more <unk> because I won.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On the night, a <unk> came and told us she had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
You have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
Have not been <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people we were and how life would be <unk> we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, of the right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in every single <unk> the constant rate of the motor, the vast horizon that is not <unk>
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them <unk> I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother is so far here in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the ancient Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior at the Indian warrior <unk> I was <unk> he was <unk> and she was <unk> on the ground, she would get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that blew my mind.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for me the most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones and the luxury clocks and the cameras can prevent it away.
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I told me, I was told this technological world to see how to use it to make magic.
I <unk> books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device, able to connect to the readers.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
So by getting the text with the image, the animation, the sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  he says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I go back to a book in the book.
At a number of times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live alive because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic, to those ideas that <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always became exciting to me.
So over here, we have to <unk> the iPad to release firefly fireflies.
And, really, they light your way into the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And it opens up a map.
In all fantasy books, there always have been maps but static maps.
This is a map that's growing, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book you also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary <unk>
These are the <unk>
We've all heard <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the <unk> cameras for millennia, in an old and moist book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have no way to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the camera or iPad, and to collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So in order to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and on a chapter -- a picture of a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
And within the landscape of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction in the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on it, and through <unk> it sees a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inner <unk>
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves the screen.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology to be closer to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that joy and joy and child's love, that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop hearing patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects we have to listen to listening.
This is my Wi-Fi <unk> it's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
All morning <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I was a challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple that every time I got it, send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time I need <unk> <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect myself to my <unk> Wi-Fi and before I got up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure on the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people in their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
So from next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were <unk> from their houses, take their blood pressure -- <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they get back to control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video video.
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the <unk> closest to help this patient?
We asked it, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the <unk> to see a <unk> please see them <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in the middle of the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> they can use their iPhone, and for the next few weeks to use their phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> what can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to focus on globally.
We are <unk> all of our colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for <unk> <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please take care of this and not only improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take on their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my passion before the drawing of the drawing -- but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was about planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start the press <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
Are the details or the <unk>
<unk> the light?
What does it create <unk>
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end, this is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and you put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It is really combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture looks realistic as realistic as I think they are not even <unk> the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something looks bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go on to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos combined must be the same kind of light.
And these two images come along with these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make an impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect job.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
So here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom of it is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And so I think it's easier to create a place that will find out because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For instance, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores of a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a stone well.
And yes, I even made red the house at the top of the island, so it looks more <unk>
So to achieve an realistic outcome, I think it needs to be planning.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details -- but the general side.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, and so many other things we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in the <unk> scale.
I'm going to talk about <unk> curves is something new.
So here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because I write about paper.
Why do we make technology <unk> on <unk> scales.
The answer is, if you draw them in a normal curve, where you say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you do that, for example, another technology, like transportation, a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a change in <unk>
If the transport technology technology was as fast as the <unk> last morning, we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development history that every few years, orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't follow forever.
You can't hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it becomes a typical <unk> I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all you can do.
I'm optimistic, why I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: what is that new way that the world embraces the world?
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
It's a transformation, and we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years ago, because everything will be so different that I extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand that is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is that the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back about half a half a half million years when the Earth was a big rock with lots of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way these chemicals <unk> we give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there were floating around with <unk> oil <unk> with all kinds of chemicals inside it.
Some of those <unk> oil <unk> had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to incorporate the outside and then drops <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops were not living in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> they <unk> a distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every drop was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow <unk> themselves to be better at the time of bringing chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Most of them lived longer -- they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, and it was very simple, but things become interesting when these drops learned the <unk> trick.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved half a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the people from airport security.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of a lot for all of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
That made these cells be happy about a billion years.
But then there was another great step in which things are <unk> very different and was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information into the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and they <unk> them to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in a way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community would become more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came to so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities <unk> communities of many kinds of different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community as responsible for <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave you an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to evolutionary period.
So a organism, for example, learn how to eat a certain fruits because he knew evil and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that before they had built these structures of information processing that would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of it.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures enormously accelerated to evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea -- a really complicated idea.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that kept some analogy with mine.
But we take a little bit very complicated that we turn it into sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
So that now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we started doing <unk>
Now we go through periods of similar periods to <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods of <unk> and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer <unk> the <unk> and so on, these are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And we've now accelerated time again.
The first stages of history that told you, took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The <unk> language, they took less than a million years.
And the <unk> like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that <unk> its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we're looking at in this curve, basically.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the <unk> designers, we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that I didn't possibly can, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please run a hundred million pieces of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those more ones that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to be closer to numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they better do the <unk>
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now <unk> the ones that are best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
So let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that children will <unk> the properties of these two programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
It <unk> some mutations in it.
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are <unk> <unk>
In fact, they are programs much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to try and see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they're becoming complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that are there.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog time to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant of our part that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up some of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat my talk, talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
<unk> is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300, from a <unk> who <unk> 300.
That means that the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the first base, not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
<unk>
You know how to call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's a 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like legendary <unk> Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> in <unk> <unk> in a regular season.
Now I <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a record of 400 to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a <unk> place, and a dear self has two <unk> <unk> <unk> and his family physician derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know something?
She's pretty much better at getting this year.
And your hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask them.
What do you think it must be the average of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the entire medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon.
What we do, though, is <unk> the world, and I would wake up with the mandate of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school, said Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood <unk>
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nursing home of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> frequent <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was going to be very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school in medicine with the impression that if it was all about it, then it would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because this is how I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident at a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the lady in the emergency room where I worked in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I was the emergency room to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient.
I will report to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what was hitting me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, instead of <unk> the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and so there are a hard way to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would give you.
I gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did this for a good reason.
I probably didn't want to be a resident who <unk> constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, he didn't take a voice on my inside that I was like, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that I was taking care of the Mrs. <unk> <unk> who is okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yeah, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high and the ambulance together with the <unk> she took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that time I did something I don't normally do normally,
I went to the emergency room service home.
And there is another nurse, not that I was taking out of the lady in <unk> but another one, I told me three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear people too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: Do you remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent to her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
I said, "Well, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I returned to the edge of death.
By an hour of an hour he had come to her home, after I read the high and her family called the <unk> his family called the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just breathe and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise your blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> it was in intensive care, and I expected all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was clear that you never <unk>
It had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> what was happening.
And to the ninth day, they left Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The past weeks I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt <unk> <unk> not feeling that healthy shame because you can't relate to your colleagues.
You make it peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that <unk>
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I was sure that I would get the things and made sure that I don't <unk>
And I kept getting these questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send him back home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little about that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make more errors, would I avoid those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an expert in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got to a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
I gave him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he was heading at the door he was still going to address his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head <unk> my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
Well, he went back and had no <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can Google <unk> It's an infection, not the throat, but from the upper <unk> and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He didn't die.
You get <unk> antibiotics down and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same shift in the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculus <unk>
I <unk> an X-ray X-ray but it turned out a regular colleague of mine who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon a surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
I read a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I would <unk>
And I checked it and see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They both were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
It would be embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get my <unk> and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would come up to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard of failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust you would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that wasn't. Those who don't sleep, and the ones that I know have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you bring out of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will stay for a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about <unk> and medical journalism, I have made a personal study of bad <unk> medical failures and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote for the first paper that I wrote for the <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one of every 10 drugs in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system that <unk> infections are increasingly more and more <unk> <unk> and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian by <unk> medical <unk>
The US Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't have <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain in the chest.
Now, take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and <unk> and <unk> and suddenly, my story is <unk> in contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals likely to mistake, well, they won't be one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art -- this is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, and they accept it, and it's not being proud of their mistakes, but it will try to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with intention of <unk> but a loving way and support and support for all of them to recover.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they become <unk>
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot but I am trying to learn something that can convey others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three <unk> <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
You know how much we choose for a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choice that says to pick an average American, it's about 70 to a day.
Not a lot ago, in research on a week to a group of CEOs in business.
The researchers recorded the different tasks by these CEOs and the time that we would spend in making decisions with those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every work included lots and lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of a <unk>
How do you <unk> the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the oil <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for me to give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> supermarket <unk> at least in that time was <unk>
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of <unk> and <unk> over 500 different fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was like, why did I buy nothing?
This is the shelf oil shelf here.
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses that were full of tourist to come every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>

They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a post for <unk> right to the shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, in what people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
From the ones who stopped when it was 24, only three percent got to buy <unk>
When I had six, I saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, decide not to buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choice is affecting it in good <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the <unk> financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, of amongst some 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement savings plans to be able to save the <unk>
And we discovered that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, until 59 options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of hedge funds, there were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of engaging the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, as much as it was the number of choice, more people are <unk> by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As much choices, they were more willing to invest in financial health services.
But no one of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to the offer more and more possibilities.
What is most likely to make the decision, that <unk> even when this goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things more likely to pick things out, even though it feels better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to try to contrast and to choose of that awesome <unk>
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we've <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, the costs, will have a better experience in choice.
When you <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent <unk>
When the Golden Gate <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> of cats who are less <unk> became <unk> in <unk> by two higher sales and lower costs.
You know that today's <unk> are offered 45,000 products.
In a grocery store there is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle the choices is David <unk> David <unk> program.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe <unk>
People who really want to choose, you are offered to <unk> not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are between those choices.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before we started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He said to me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience with a <unk> with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. All right. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
Not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information at the first <unk> than at the second point, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the behavioral overload which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences should be feeling very <unk> very <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when you use debit cards or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it even more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
That meeting is exactly how we <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we appeal to the staff that you would think about the positive things that they would take in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway that we did in a discussion.
We saw that in <unk> <unk> throughout the <unk> <unk> exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But do you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think about, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity <unk>
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these are decisions vary in the number of choices that we offer each other.
<unk> color outside of the car. I'm 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few choices, four meters -- 56 colors, a lot of choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
What about you here.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that the ones that are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information is presented.
If we started the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of changes does not say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that we are having more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
So I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the communist East Germany, if you had a writing machine, I had to get rid of the government.
I had to register a piece of <unk> text with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a piece of the wrong message that they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is <unk> the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any single manufacturer and it prints a page, that page will end up having some <unk> yellow dots on every single page that makes a pattern of one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be a lot of fun for this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups <unk>
Are you <unk>
like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, so large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to rob money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The American secret service was two months ago, <unk> the Swiss mind of this guy, Sam <unk> and this <unk> had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> don't know your <unk>
And I say this today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in worse.
In the future, most crimes happen online.
The second group of Health that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, the protests, they motivate them the laughs laughter.
<unk> as Anonymous has <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a prominent role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of the government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> fall because of a <unk>
We would raise the security of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week I asked the last week with representative government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> to <unk> the death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except we had a foreign <unk> authority.
And that was <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt -- the <unk> protesters based on the Muslim secret police in April 2011 and during the entire city, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government for <unk> the communications of citizens in the country.
They had this tool for 25,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
So Western governments provide the tools to governments for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
We had even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right now that will be <unk> today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the South Park in the South Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my father, the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no <unk> in the highest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and why we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
People are dying that they protect our community and the livestock and are also angry at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age six at nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that I would do to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of.
But I realized that actually doesn't <unk> because I could even help lions see the pen <unk>
I don't have <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that she was about the <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, but the second day, it doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, male lions came out.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that will turn out and turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk> lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load battery and battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights together.
As you can see, the <unk> they go out, because that's where the lions.
And this is how lions see it when they come at night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never became a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals all lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You <unk> you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them on seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants of farms.
Because of this <unk> I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise money and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them and show them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes and he said to me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when it grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saved the cows of my dad and the lions, can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't think of how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a fence for a close or CA: <unk> <unk>
<unk> I know that the fences were invented but I want to do mine.
CA: So I'm going to do it once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> every step I would have friend mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although I was sometimes wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed in North Korea.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When you put this out, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks of the family.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so robust, we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory.
A woman who was living in the street, holding a kid in her arms looking at his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine took in North Korea to <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
It also became more and more prevalent the <unk> of energy, all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> at certain points, enabling North Koreans <unk>
But many of you die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life as a refugee <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous because the refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and stood up at the police station, and he <unk>
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and so many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to happen.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the time, a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to leave, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and finding work, all of his world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why, after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to bring up to South Korea going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call my pride, mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea it was not easy, did a plan. I began to study for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities have a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be displaced to force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, took a flight to China and <unk> me towards the border in North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked everybody's identification and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way up to the <unk> border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all for releasing my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at a short distance from the <unk> embassy of South Korea.
And I was going and came from the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or a voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why would you <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I am helping the people to <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown to <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when they <unk>
And I showed myself that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need it.
Over the time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the struggle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical practices of the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with family is still in family with still having information that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans a chance to thrive in international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center for <unk> stores for fast food, fast <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, "We're going to change the South Korean name, so it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this <unk> what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South <unk>  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other American Americans, in a desert of food, Los Angeles Medical Center for food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring there more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> that is about 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and it's the solution.
I am also tired of trying to drive 45 minutes back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides in it.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> that we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, nine <unk> <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of paid group <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone is <unk>
The city <unk> me on top of and at <unk> I was given a <unk> saying I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made of <unk>
And I would say, "Come on in right?
A court of planting food on a piece of land that no one <unk>   So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the written story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's 20 <unk> <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why the hell don't it look like this?
<unk> a <unk> plant.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give a 75 dollars for a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. I <unk> my kids there.
And I was <unk> to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to share my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Like a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> soils <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, they're my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do. If you let them be your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, in transformation from my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at the night and they were in my garden, and they were <unk>
I, like, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I was hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people go to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Oh my God, no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's what it is on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared her stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had -- like about 50 people coming from, and they work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, the guys will eat <unk>
If none of you are going to eat tomatoes,  But if none of these are <unk> if you don't teach them how food is affecting your mind and your body, eat blind people in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where they're caught. I see some color who are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who were <unk> their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy <unk>
I don't have <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because it's free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you take your <unk> <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, you're not calling me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree to agree that this is a <unk>
It's made out of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, that it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go into your bike, and these cars go by, that's not really nice.
Also, asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a road road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and now it has pores and water can move through it, so that all water is going to flow down the sides and you will have a road that it's easy to drive, and you won't make water anymore.
Noise is disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that in this road the stones on the surface <unk>
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more, and you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
And here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they were separating from the <unk>
So if you're driving around the road, you will get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel in that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool on very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits out of the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel to the steel, melt the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones <unk> again.
Today I used a <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave <unk> is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this stuff.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this is going to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
So we did the samples, we put a lot of payload in them, and we put them together with our <unk> machine and we went back to a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, <unk> these fibers, using <unk> energy to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, actually, to increase the lives of the surface -- they can actually double a lot of money on the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool back before I can show you how to repair it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening <unk> to his little gray radius.
He had a huge smile in her face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban will <unk> my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made the girls illegal girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we took a different route for anybody to suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in market bags so it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the street.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was closed suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to go?
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. So his daughter, my mother, my mother, was to the school and why his father was <unk>
But my mother mother became teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his kids had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> to the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life, and I was always scared and I couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can give it to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, to do it.
So, you still want to do it."
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age had more than the middle of the age, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate her daughters, and was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why we <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite them and even in front of a <unk> opposition,
As a <unk> it's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When I got to her home, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if she was still sending his daughter to school, they would give it to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for your old and <unk>
What I've seen from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there's a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers are not key to our success.
In fact, these are the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would be <unk> that these changes are not <unk> much after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, I see a <unk> future and <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day, the girls of <unk> I would give it to me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of mass <unk> as much as the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
<unk> and young men <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to meet the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have loved with a lot of other women -- to rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a competitive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, democracy.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops on developing capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a <unk> of women leaders, the very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and by our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> than <unk> of selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk> and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the early elections in 52 years.
However, little to little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the murder of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news murder of the military officers <unk>
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights <unk> and their lack of <unk> of law.
Our society formed by a <unk> mentality is <unk> more, and it's far away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the cones of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation we chose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize OK.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and candidate brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much as women as <unk>
Maybe what happened was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the elections, which just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> depiction of <unk> more than need the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech -- not just <unk> but also putting the <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of the competition, inclusion and <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, needs desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interconnection and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish the existential way before they do it <unk>
According to the Koran <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions of the <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which spans all of humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the villages and all the towns and all the people have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers entirely <unk> which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of existence.
So he goes, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
So you say, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They are all <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a compelling question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is what everybody does. Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I create my alma mater, <unk> to my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a political <unk> <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies of <unk> <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all of the religions, all of the income income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only men, and long-term abuse or said -- in the families, the last place we want or we would expect or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be left with a man who sticks, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, November November of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York subway and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he also had <unk> from a University of <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and it seemed a guy in the field.
I had big <unk> like apples, and a hair <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was list -- that I had gone to Harvard, that was a passion for helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, like anyone had ever done it.
And it was why the <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was left from New York and leaving my dreams for my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your spouse, and so I <unk> left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical trap financial and psychological <unk> <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the violence to see how it reacts to.
And this is where those guns.
As soon as we moved into the New England you know, that site where you were supposed to do, I had to feel so sure she bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another that kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed these guns to cause the trauma to have a little bit of a <unk>
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never worked my hand my life, my life was already serious serious every single day.
The first <unk> physical attack was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the <unk> suit from my mother and married him.
Despite what there was happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved him and he wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact to form a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I never would do any more.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving around our moon of honey was <unk> by the traffic and threw a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in his life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and he was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do because we have us, because we have us, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence happen after the victim has moved to the <unk> after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> it has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to <unk> the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still ask why it's simply not <unk>
I was able to <unk> it because of one last <unk> it beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, to the police, to the police, my neighbors and my friends and full friends and full <unk> and I'm here today because all of you help me.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> <unk> as if the <unk> victims are <unk> <unk> <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and to bring their lives <unk> and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very <unk>
I was marrying a nice man and kind gentle and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to you is ever a <unk> <unk> <unk> in my head of someone who says she wants.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> how stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were a little bit of them or that they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse just in silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
We need the victims all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse of light talking about it with her children, her coworkers and family and family.
<unk> your vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow their climb and show the victims of the <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that right now, there's a very awkward tension in the room because I should not have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of lucky <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to stop them now, but then find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to spend this sweater for your head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I get my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he was going to get her back and <unk> the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or a <unk> artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our aspect, which, even though it's superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not defined the beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape -- and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that we're going on. There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told every single one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that is, less than four percent, not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> magazine magazine or <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model of a model that you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you might choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have the studies, and you have a <unk> and you have a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but you want to be president of the United States, but you have a <unk> Model <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would be weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal space, but it was a little girl.
And so he looked next to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and the fifth week.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people would always ask me is: <unk> for free?
I have too many inches <unk> and I would never use, except the couple couple of <unk> but the privilege that I get is the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I was given the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red <unk> and of course, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges by my respect, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their behavior regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the <unk> teenagers who were left and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do you <unk>
When we research for this talk, I learned that for 53 percent of 13 percent of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure gets to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it would be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious and <unk>
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I've never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask them, you know, with a <unk> legs and the more brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs that have the most brilliant hair and their clothes more than fashion -- but probably the women physically insecure of the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody gets more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image of the image of the image that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you with you 15 more <unk> photos and I didn't get the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum <unk>
In fact, most of them were taken up by random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo to me holding my daughter on the day of her first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
I just happened to go back to New York a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes in now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take them to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than the representations of concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October last week and we have to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, even though we got the same picture, our daughter changes, new <unk> and I can see life through her eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking, when all of a sudden he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls that they <unk> small in the previous papers.
And he described me what had felt at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that I remembered their heart <unk> with strength when nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of family pictures.
I'm always getting the picture.
So today, I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get back to somebody and asked him, you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs as <unk> <unk> stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and <unk> <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that relate to Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment,   <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> in New World that are mostly found in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 face of extinction.
So why are the <unk> <unk> First of all, they provide ecological services <unk>
It's our <unk> <unk>
They <unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that not to be by them would <unk> and causing large losses and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the students are taking three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the U.N., and in Egypt.
In the mythology of Hindu <unk> it was the god of <unk> and risked his life to save the god. <unk> Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they make very important <unk> to open <unk> in places like <unk> there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk>
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are in extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list, of extinction, that means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that's been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned <unk> in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread of the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up in the Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
It's <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. Are we <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a problem locally and it's not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. They can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. <unk> their time to get the word <unk> the word.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw fly <unk> no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to 1977. <unk> young man, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would do, we <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where I was an Italians in which we decided to teach people of <unk> to grow food.
So we got to the seeds of <unk> the south of Zambia into this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the river <unk> and we teach local tomatoes Italians and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all at all at the way to do that, so they were going to tell them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were very excited about the local <unk> in so fertile valley, they didn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't go to <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa is <unk> <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato <unk> in Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only we were only Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what the American did, what the <unk> did, and after seeing what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western organizations, we've given the continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
You just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
It should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at the age of 27 years to just answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you ever motivate anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You would never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, at once, they <unk> but not in meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never will tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance they have <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The most intelligent people in your community, you don't even know it, because they don't meet their public meetings.
What do we do? We do one to one and work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business -- that it sets up with you in your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to move away from this junk garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How can we do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so I <unk>     So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you.
You have to offer you for a <unk> privacy, which has to be fantastic about the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 <unk>
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show you is more like this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneur <unk> is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution not renewable <unk> and from one time to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There aren't the technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a remarkable story that in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year they came together with this group of people, and they <unk> respect to what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is keeping up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in the next 40 years, in the United States <unk> French companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> was Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
In the other way, they're not going to come with you.
Then you have to offer a absolute <unk> <unk> service.
And then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smallest company, the larger company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell -- has to be a fantastic, you have to have a fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, to sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman did for you, what someone did for this gentleman is talking about this <unk> someone who asked you, what needs to take?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really predict a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad point?
How do you share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the cow stores so that our communities can reflect our own needs and dream today.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
There is always <unk> to music --  there's a show in New York City,  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most Indian property properties.
I live near this house, and I thought how could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this gives me a deep gratitude to gratitude for the time and so much.
He gave her clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I <unk> for keeping this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me it's easy to be able to be able to be able to catch on the day and to forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this home house on a giant slate and painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> for <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of change <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to do more."
Before I die I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
"Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at me, and they got comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. This is about understanding our neighbors in new new ways and <unk> it's about <unk> and <unk> and remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and we change ourselves.
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit kit and now have been seen in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us an opportunity to express each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that <unk> us more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and more media to share fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
Don't speak, but transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> shares what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When they sing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I can't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel She's 16 years old. It's high. It's very hot.
<unk> memory more <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out of one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into a <unk> concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- that was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
In each individual it manifests in a different way, that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the developmental disorders that quickly increases in the world, there's no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things -- like putting car cars around the room, looking out the washing machine and eat whatever you have about it.
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the endless hyperactivity there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent -- a child who would see the world without <unk> a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that I have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they would not want to change for the normal.
<unk> happens the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift in your inner and, honestly, to search for normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change in the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what has been <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
Penn State asked me, a teacher of communications, who would give me a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was scared.  And I was really scared.  <unk> from these students with their big minds, their big books and their big unknown words.
But when those conversations were done, I felt what <unk> had felt when he fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
So I felt like I had those conversations with the students with the students that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our bigger challenges from energy to environment and health care, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that the science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making dumb ones.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, which is everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to think is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to hook up and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked why they call <unk>  What do you do <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of the language of our brain, and we <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only of the <unk> <unk>
So the trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give our graphs to <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help everyone else open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford Oxford <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an <unk> publisher of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that I look for a public care <unk> or a <unk> and that, when he wins, I get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what <unk> means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that Parliament British Parliament enabled the newspapers to quote the exact words that they said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
He was placed in the <unk> London <unk> and he <unk> but she had enough courage to face them, and eventually he had a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later we had the first record of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It isn't. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions you might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed term.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it a King why he gave him or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> more <unk> and most unfortunate title than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a title as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> it was the title of President.
President Barack Obama are lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stay waiting for years more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you about it, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Everything if you have more than 5,000 <unk> and <unk> and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of aerial aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has <unk> the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, just <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations are now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 <unk> and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be humble when you tell them you're now the president of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually change the words much more than the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in an illegal <unk> mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> from heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that talk about, but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I wear an cheapest <unk> of light, she holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in that hole that falls hundreds of feet on earth.
And he <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met earlier before, who lost control and fell <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole by giving their lives not paid or reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home and I went home, but they will never do it because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures, native in over 70 countries in six countries and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as <unk>
When we end up talking to me I was really sad, I was just trying to ignore this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
It was made me like my stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people who are <unk> in the world.
It's twice the amount of African Africans during the whole human <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, you can do this today for entire families for <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over 50 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false <unk> promises of good education promises and better work to find that they're forced to work without sacrificing under violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> the <unk> goods of slaves have value, but those are the ones that produce these are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and <unk> I met the brick <unk>
This strange and <unk> show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- all the <unk> <unk> <unk> mechanically ventilated bricks in their head, until 18 to the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no breaks to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> made it just quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side and quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it.
And he explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen of that country.
Could we put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system by his liberation and she trusted that <unk>
As I waited to come home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> stones for miles on land <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were heavy than the kids who charge and the children <unk> them to their heads with straps and <unk> and ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all of his life.
They have nothing to be <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness -- I would tell me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been <unk>
It took me on a <unk> <unk> that would give this dirty basement of <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it's known in craft, are local <unk>
They have small, <unk> rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven -- are posed to the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every name is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer with sexual abuse of their clients.
From standing in the <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> on the stairs I had a <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexually traffic happens all around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the silk trade.
This is a family.
Little black hands are the father, the blue of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My <unk> told me the stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, you can get out of this house one day and go to another place where you really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a look fast.
I saw what it seemed like to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids make sense of it.
<unk> They were all <unk>
The children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me there was <unk> topic that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> they often catch networks and children, and <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, he's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when we <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
On the cold night and <unk>
And I'll point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a <unk> with her <unk> suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and touched the window.
They asked us to do it for a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we went back to the car, and he asked the driver that went out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the road, this is the path.
As we started <unk> we removed the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as he <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a <unk> and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer camp and everybody were full of enslaved.
A lot of women had kids attached to their backs, and as they were looking for gold <unk> it would be <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a pump in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people take heavy heavy rock bags and then they'll be shipped down to another area in which they <unk> the stone, so you can extract the gold.
When you look at it, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the end, we see other <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle as a slave force in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors were saying it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- what inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw a light out of slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give you testimony of them and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really think that if we can see each other as human beings, then you do very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> These are real people, as you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day when I don't think about these many beautiful people, beautiful people, I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images show a force in those you see, in people like you, and I hope that the turning on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery -- because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there's a particular problem for the <unk> we are like management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of the <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's destroy <unk> this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous <unk>
In the last few years, it's a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if you really have an objective cure when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not biological <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam <unk>
It wouldn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a conventional way for a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy while there is a sounds of talking, and we can imagine as the dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- for example.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learn to talk.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as they <unk> and as the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
In the bottom below, you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of <unk> ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more peaceful and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do these test tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but the <unk> exams.
I mean, they can be <unk>
They get very rapidly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
It's <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something acquires a cost of cost, it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce the medical difficulties.
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get the targets.
We could make recruitment for low-cost cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or without Parkinson's, it can call under price and leave recordings of cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Right.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of disease.
TR: You've got a <unk> <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has made a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's <unk>
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
Are we <unk> creatures.
We <unk> it in the dark, in the rooms without windows and, by the large, we avoid sunlight.
We have thin models still more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we do the impossible -- and we <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> There was <unk> <unk> it was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, together with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level is reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers on the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We take a rubble from channels and <unk>
We were <unk> and we removed the mud and we left ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish from dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local <unk>
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from the villages around them for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that these people had <unk>
As I <unk> from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean toilets -- enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> center was <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years ago, some of them were still in the lab on the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I went into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started tweaking the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should get rid of a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they got more kind of photos and it got more kind of photos and it took more <unk> so this is that he entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we went to <unk> a people to the north of <unk>
Once we used to use our scanner in the <unk> <unk> libraries that were <unk> where people would reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could get an hour. I could be a weeks.
I could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw in practically hand using the areas whose color areas and the color and the water had no <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that were <unk> in seawater, and with algae even with algae -- all of it -- all of that with the time of time I continue to <unk> because it was a major part of the project.
We couldn't tweak the picture unless it was clean dry and dry and <unk> by its <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a guide neighbor of <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As I once <unk> the leader of my group is like doing a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky enough to the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but stopped the realization that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to reconstruct it in a single picture of a photo and tweaking the whole picture.
When you picked up their pictures I shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos on a firemen station between the rubble station between where she used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk> it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His little sons, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find her family and knew that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his youngest son at the age of 14 years.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could remember from the past that he would remember from the past that had had no <unk> on March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there, and hundreds of them were helped to clean up more of <unk> photographs -- the big <unk> -- most of them went back to their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families to get hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend over 1,000 dollars in equipment and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one thing, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take away, but the first thing you would look for.
So this was the project of restore small pieces of humanity, to bring to someone your connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone a huge difference in the life of the person who are <unk>
This project also made a great difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to bring something bigger to something, using your talent for something that are not thin <unk>
So to finish my email I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I went back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture with women in different ages from the grandmother to the small child, <unk> around a baby, and I was <unk> because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, I and my <unk> daughter <unk>
In the entire world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> was inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition for just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but to a trillion hours per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion.
And so we can create cameras that can look after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it and <unk> it in a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter wide millimeter in a <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse the photons into this <unk>
What is the <unk> <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't take this research --  -- <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started looking at these <unk>
Many of the photons finally gets to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
And in that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottle, after several boxes, that some <unk> would be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it <unk> the same distance and see it in a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us to see that film?
A week? Actually, a week?
It would be a boring film --  of a slow <unk>
And how about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the wall of the wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> <unk>
But if you look at a more time more of this <unk> you'll notice that, as the light stands to be <unk> it still bright. It doesn't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside it and it comes back from several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the low exposure, it comes very little light in.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so you can barely get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package <unk> <unk> millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> them to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those things in crude and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a superhero would allow him to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, one part will reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point they accounted to be the distance.
By projecting a laser can record a picture in <unk> that, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, and we are going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our rebuilding
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going around the curve, the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light reflected in the open windows open.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the interior of the body by <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new <unk> mode of visualizing the problems of <unk> <unk>
Like Doc <unk> he was a scientist, he turned science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just scientific visualizations but we can see it.
So create a new form of computer photography with slow <unk> and color colors.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these will leave us from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, I would have loved to see this image.
The order of the events in the world sometimes happens to the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding and corresponding of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, it would go to <unk> and be famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who were <unk> that you <unk> in search of a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
<unk> have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European <unk> company, every Internet <unk> has to store a wide range of the user information.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends him a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And across Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone to and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for favor of all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to <unk> and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information, because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, an agreement.
They <unk> the demand and they send me the information I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 information lines.
I saw them and said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data means <unk>
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go back, go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, and we're talking about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this huge communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other what time they communicate to each other -- what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the center, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to <unk> them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and it's not very <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to show you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why I <unk> all the time.

It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, even though they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not <unk> and I don't want any of them to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled at any time.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> of Christmas, are in the commercial mall, drive in circles for parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And thinking, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love my neighborhood, and my illness had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe the <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three younger sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters came to public school, my parents <unk> the school system and <unk> that I was also out of me, and if I didn't get all the top score -- all of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk at five years putting my <unk> on her feet and just walking.
Another expectation that I used was just to hang on a dollar in front of me so that we can do it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day at the kindergarten walked as a <unk> <unk> who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic and keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think of appropriate to be able to use <unk> to <unk> like <unk>
The people I grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to be <unk> I was as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> it so I was drinking milk -- so I was drinking milk on the back, <unk> me on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I did yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
Everyone <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top score on my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
And finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> I mean, I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
In the end of the end, <unk> <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, ask them why and she said to me because they believed I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the venture stunts either.
It was a role for the one that was literally born and gave it to an actor with no brain <unk>
<unk> was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I <unk> I went home, and my first <unk> tour was as an extra <unk>
My dream was made true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I couldn't see myself more than <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> with disability.
It just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
And in my first tour, he took <unk> <unk> in New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that I took when she fell at the account that I was at high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had <unk>
I worked in clubs. All the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my <unk> and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind you to remind the art <unk> that <unk> and Arabs are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program on the cable that has Keith <unk>
I walked up as if I were to a graduate dance, I would join a studio and I sat down in a wheelchair.
And I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the <unk> desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of a full-time participant and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never <unk> from me or even higher.
All of a sudden, my Internet on the Internet became <unk>
I would see video clips online with <unk> like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What is that?
We should really pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less <unk>
Or maybe not.
We probably still need a whole society to teach our children.
My lend to travel to really spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab <unk> Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the <unk> state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give the <unk> refugees to be a fraction of what my parents <unk> me.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This town is about <unk>
<unk> <unk> small people to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
Maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read a guy who gives him to <unk> him after dinner, and after dinner <unk>
She meets a dynamic group of people, which gives a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new <unk> money to send home to their family.
They present a young person.
They finally come home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That little boy from that little town with the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a little town of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, wanting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled it from what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> <unk>
For the young, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three out of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital in front of me and <unk> thinking, and if I never got it gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some youth leaders at a business <unk>
<unk> to about 90 youth leaders, <unk>
We sat there and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate college college student, unemployed, I was the perfect white white <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point A is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
She started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with your family and friends, and his dream is somewhere to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different <unk>
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people on the summit of business initiative and how to create a cultural initiative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic to sent from abroad.
If you gave somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he began to grow <unk> and <unk> who said he could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working in creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, they can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought to start a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO to work for government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be as much as they could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So let's inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance for <unk> in the development and set out of their business.
<unk> to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to the creation, and to create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their <unk> <unk> this is how it calls it when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
He gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> paralysis <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the youngsters in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and to eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace than <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was meant that <unk> leaves like a <unk> and not going to be the way that we were born, we can almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> aluminum balls, and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where they <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> our <unk> for 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> <unk> every day.
I wanted to know us as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and she walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities all over town, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asked about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies still <unk> the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the waste collection is one of the <unk> most dangerous <unk> and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for your service.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about <unk>
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It's always going to be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think strongly that the <unk> of waste are the most important hand hand in the city streets for three reasons.
They're the first protective of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in form and effective every day, this starts <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
<unk> we had <unk> for decades and centuries back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have room for what the motors in the economy start to fail when it's endangered people.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, I just pointed to your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed necessary.
So I mean just the speed of the way they used to move out at the time of <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or we carry on with us our coffee cup -- our <unk> bag -- our water bottle.
We use them -- we forgot about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that it would take to it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe helps to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
Are you in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
You know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our job.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after 9/11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a collection of waste collection on the street, grabbed my little child, and I went down the stairs and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank for doing his work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the garbage collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
<unk> waste -- what we think when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the nation of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one that you see somebody whose job is to clean the junk of you, take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a mall in the capital of <unk> Addis <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to be able to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> is generating heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because this is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what it looks like has nothing to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the ancient market that is this structure into the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a <unk> building, of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of the city growth zone, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not existed.
And it's between two parallel streets that don't communicate at an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, showing all the entries from the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that will be <unk> by its own way, and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and that helped me shape the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building overnight.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what we <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the center of the mall because they had more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more <unk> not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short about every day.
So we get a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we thought about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which in conjunction collect water for inner <unk>
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project to do a big project, the biggest thing I've ever designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I had special attention on <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with 12 <unk> doors connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets -- creating 12 early blocks similar to the size and features there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some <unk> points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation, was thinking of the cell, the small cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a scheme that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> blocks and then in the <unk> plant, we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up greater density at higher levels and lower density in the ground floor.
And it <unk> this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving to the community that space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and <unk> and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jumping from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change the communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings grow.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had great amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of the state of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I was <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the <unk> of the school. It was a little bit late and <unk> me in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my master <unk>
And then I did.
I put the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit of this.
All the things like --  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I just get a line of that, just for being there, because <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was fascinated by the reason why I was bothered by that this little little girl was so nice to <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
There is also <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that looks for loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that they study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's a exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> <unk> no <unk>
It wouldn't have King <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It wouldn't be Shakespeare.
I <unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No <unk> no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the <unk> almost all of them.
This year is a hundred years of his work masterpiece, "In search of time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as tough as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how it is <unk> but we suppose it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> them and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the <unk> that get reduced to the person, to their wish, they are a <unk> narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being to storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to be <unk> to <unk> the knife -- right?
<unk> do all the <unk> <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure maybe right now."
And he starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm he <unk> <unk> <unk> he adds to his collection of <unk> instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if you wanted to break it with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job, right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is that successful --  <unk> links the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is on its <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their <unk> then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These scientific research with true <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, which is a really painful truth, in fact, to <unk> -- the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> These were the pathways for the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be, who makes us realize -- causes us a range of much more profound feelings than a wise man that can be <unk>
It's telling us we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there is some emotion that makes us open ourselves in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk> intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud had been visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife was <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird about that man, which is not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it, <unk>
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
<unk> described very well how we <unk> us to look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I am thinking about eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A <unk> woman from 52 years old was captured by having created an fake account on Facebook from which he would send <unk> messages to himself, for a year.
For a year. It was all year.
She was trying to <unk> the new <unk> of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though it <unk> Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books about how the <unk> <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to invade your own and <unk> of what you once <unk> and it's under the ground -- you get your <unk> it takes your rings, empty your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I would be.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street <unk> and ask, <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of the <unk> but <unk> it.
Oh, this sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but it <unk> it and <unk> them with <unk> on each of these mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times as we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as an geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> there's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to the other?
Well, perhaps we don't have to <unk> from the greatness of another.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that this happens, let's remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is <unk> the jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> he invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July Buzz Buzz Aldrin jumped out the <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the dark <unk> was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest casualties of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA has spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo <unk> <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which <unk> after death murder last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the <unk> words at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn to our goal?
And you might also ask, why would you climb the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would we fly over the <unk>
Why is <unk> <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're good, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the contemporaries, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of the significance of the technology of technology.
They were because it was something great about it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology's suffering.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and was eliminated the smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin was in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a ship with a <unk> but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / <unk>
From 1970, no human has become the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of the power of technology has been <unk> when we see that the technology was going to be going to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk> 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't go to the <unk> escape <unk> the rocket.
I knew I think that this would be the last <unk> <unk> but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that honest thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had <unk> and there were enriched toys, with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't <unk> the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, in Silicon Valley, that have been created by less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which we have to, Intel and Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of ideas that are <unk> by <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what goes wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the capitalists of risk were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been trouble investing with benefit in technologies like energy, which need tremendous capital and whose development is long-term capital -- not yet invested in the development of technologies that are dedicated to solving large problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's global energy consumption is from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely <unk>
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, of entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development and some kind of control price control.
But there is no hope at the current political climate that we're going to see an energy energy policy or <unk> that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn it out.
We know from doing time that famines are a result of failure in the route of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects the food distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and route of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon stated the war in 1971, but soon we found out there are a lot of kinds of cancer, some <unk> who are extremely resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to want to fix the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> because it really is a problem <unk> and we must understand it.
The mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it turns out with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how difficult and dangerous -- and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon as it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> from our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decrease in trust, is a very widespread perspective.
The second is a goal: we should have more confident.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It bow to me to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions that could have increased others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can go to opinion polls and surveys of opinion are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and political -- they follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, and they keep being quite <unk> judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But is this enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at is the generic attitudes that people believe in when you get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I probably <unk> by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them but in other <unk>
It's really rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence <unk>
We don't assume the level of trust that we're going to feel for a particular kind of <unk> official or <unk> will be uniform at all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary school that I know to give you the kind of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have to have those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a <unk> fashion.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to treat good judgment of an inherent fact to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confident.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
Isn't that the goal that I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent target in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, it says that it says, yes, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a card in the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I will use their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I haven't been <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to cover before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to succeed.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, and they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you can see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative <unk> which will be <unk> <unk>
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and we would have to think that the accountability system that's meant to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence for <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I bet you all know similar examples.
We would take all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be more <unk> if we care about being worthy of trust and <unk> the people that we're trustworthy and whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve the trust.
But <unk> ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough for them to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> it usually for all people, all the time.
But you also have to give <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks to say I can <unk> without giving <unk>
I take them up and get it back for the money, or I would change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're going on is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have come up with us to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the screen of the screen that imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started imagining how it would be.
He first created this tool that gets quiet in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers their physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands still remain on the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity from the hands?
In the <unk> division of Sciences by Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> camera to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can look through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that are down on the bottom of every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would be bought and returned in the Internet.
Now that doesn't worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
So this is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just watching pixels in space, how we can make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical physicist.
This imam <unk> behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did is we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> mechanical <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and have always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality as a physical reality as we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the <unk> of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or the text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities as well.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show you something but start to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without we have to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today about a barrier, but if I <unk> that barrier, and the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After the <unk> the Islamic Revolution believed firmly that there was only a <unk> path to <unk> a safe job <unk>
No matter whether the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be an African <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer have started to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, no authority, me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second kind of happiness.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
I <unk> the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of Nan <unk> I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books you were here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not <unk> convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and <unk>
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For instance, at the beginning of this map, this map was out of place, because this is what students in China will learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to fields of research like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why don't we do it in real life?
So I started reading books on two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For <unk> <unk> are <unk> politics and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't feel alone or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student at the clinic at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named Alex.
Alex entered the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> threw at the couch of my office and told me that I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, was made for me easy to just move the head while they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said <unk> and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work later, they come home after the death goes after the death happens.
For <unk> like Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> me to press Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Sure, that's coming out with the kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but it's not like being married with him."
And then my <unk> said, still no, but maybe it <unk> over the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and she had real consequences -- not just for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give you a way to your life have happened to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming up with their future partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage stage in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change itself, it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility is coming to its top by 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> about their body and choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your common life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk> time.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk> <unk>
The journalists <unk> <unk> names to the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough to do.
It's not true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart, intelligent, interesting people like you or your kids and the daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this <unk> <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before 30, all being right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better <unk> the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around 30, it turned out the music and all started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only guy who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of extreme -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of them start a career, choosing a city, choosing a couple, and having two children in a very short period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful doing everything once to the <unk>
<unk> crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want to do now.
<unk> realize you can't have the son that you want to now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing? What was you doing?
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or at the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living <unk> very difficult, their previous life had been even harder.
And I <unk> often on our sessions, but then he would wake up with her to say, "You don't pick his family, but she can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got her head on her legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with her many other relationships, but then I was looking at the empty space that follows after the <unk> words after the words <unk> please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in while the <unk> <unk> was going to happen.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital capital.
For your identity, I mean to do something that add to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> race and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> identity is generating identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> that you want to give you a try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds they are limited to who you know what you know, how they think about, how talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person to get out of it almost always comes out of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak links of your friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half not, and the weak bonds are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the jobs I created never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma was soon <unk> to their family, when they have a mate and there is their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is better to sit head than 20 or even the 25th or even the 25th and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live now or <unk> now when all of Facebook starts to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be an conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or kill me with whatever you get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That campaign gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves his new family, and I sent me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes that go out of the Los Angeles airport who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few or even in the following generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> they get identity, they use their weak bonds -- pick your muscles into your family.
Don't let me define why they didn't know or what they didn't.
Are you deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in <unk> <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was going to show you mathematics to <unk> <unk> in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the work came, I would go down grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no better performance <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the better way.
But what if we succeed in school and life in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who they <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children we would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of school and <unk> who will be the more effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve goals.
<unk> is a <unk>
The purpose is clinging to his future day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a race at the full speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my <unk> and then I waited for over a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> tests -- even the safety that they felt when they were in school.
So not only is it in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> in which the <unk> is also in school, especially for the risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, the little thing that science knows about what science is about.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a robust job ethic.
How do we keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  And I know that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals that are simply not ahead of their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the purpose is commonly not related or is even related to the <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that it is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start to start all again with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the figure of Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was <unk> by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who is that I want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each one of the drawings of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than let's do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 people will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic signs from <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it could be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
So if the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> I am <unk> I am <unk> This is actually <unk> the way it's called, but I like to believe it is the other way. The thing that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they think many more characters.
A person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If a person reaches your arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of recall, because a <unk> tree is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two together, it's very hot.
Three hundred together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking you questions.
<unk> <unk> is somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've been through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next bunch of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same as you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the sun.
This is a sun put up with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun along the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and <unk> Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was the imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand here.
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex shows <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took back 40 years later with, interestingly, another film that was <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy who would take a girl dressed as the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician was doing today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies generated by the computer of evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the magician magician is that the most talented characters and the characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
He wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So he was so slid in the room and was struck as a mom in the room and she was behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk>
I should feel that Luke get an army to <unk> the government?
I <unk> this with the magician from Oz <unk>
How do I make my film?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
This is the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with <unk> <unk> and not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is it so much force capital -- strength in the movies for our children, and so little on the path of bricks in <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that had served to me to navigate the world of adults which is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I really expected the credits of them to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the villain and get their reward, and they don't leave for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney Disney versus any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they guys, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is happening in classic after <unk> each of them about a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when it came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happen to be <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't held root and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic -- and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend that had had a friend of the <unk> of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the film?
And their conversations are about something more than the kid who so much like it.  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things in each other.
<unk> I've been seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> movie <unk>
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a movie Hollywood film movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test test.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have lots of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, <unk> bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films more popular, how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women say it's been sexually <unk> once in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is closely linked -- and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is defeat to violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very <unk> statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools that we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power to <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and I mean most of the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> character <unk> Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to support their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle and more stories where he saw that his job is to join a team -- maybe a team leading by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I loved was looking for <unk> on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're <unk> and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was <unk> to <unk>
I started to see and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of about 1.3 miles of length along the <unk>
And my sea <unk> had grown into the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the East Coast of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, you seem to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color and suddenly it looks like pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the ancient activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art of <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them in the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it measures about <unk> per mile <unk>
Before, Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to the east and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find them at random to be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this <unk> area that looks inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of the <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing the jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet below, under a thick thick sheet of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> <unk> we have a layer of occupation from several hundred years that date from the Roman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones and the jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation which is the <unk> in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite elite shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still haven't found <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young people in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman <unk> which was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as it looks like, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race to go in the direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door in their house.
There are <unk> flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, the rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate,
And the <unk> on the hall, or what it is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I'm talking about.
They can feel your blue <unk> <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the cookie <unk> and you get to go into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained your living room.
In the room, and by doing most of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's a little bit of clothes, dancing about his <unk> <unk> singing <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path of yellow brick and from the oven. They come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few different ages and different hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, looking at them just once.
They <unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
We have entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize more fast, the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked her, when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition says they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained us to perform these miraculous <unk> of memory using a half a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that medieval academics used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, "How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and I <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant one, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards in national television.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to teach me.
I mean, you have to start with something <unk>
And that was the start of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very much of the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how far our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on memory written over 2,000 years ago in <unk> in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> wasn't something as rare as you might look like today.
A long time ago, people are investing in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These modern world have made the modern world, but they've also changed.
It has changed, and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we already don't have any need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a <unk> memory <unk> and <unk> is this kind of competition that is so unique of memory.
It's not really as <unk> there's a <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University University of London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it will be that has brains in some ways, or a different model of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a battery for cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the ones of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a magnetic MRI machine, they <unk> your brains while they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> found that in the memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is driving as an armed race in where each year, somebody has a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise <unk> order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> and absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end of the end is cut into a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It was illustrates with a elegant paradox that was known as <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I say two people to remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> there's a man called <unk>
That's her <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> what do you do?"
The person who said to her name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said to her work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name <unk> doesn't really mean for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance in your head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They go back home to work.
You probably know some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't take a poet.
He stood up, <unk> her poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed everybody, but shattered the <unk> bodies.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they could not <unk> the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, she closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of her mind, I could see where I had been sitting every <unk>
I took the family of <unk> <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or numbers of phone numbers or instructions or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and space numbers.
If I told you that I <unk> the first 10 words of the history that I just told you about <unk> are very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who I was sitting on the horse <unk> the brown line in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- it's the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory, the same way that I would have done <unk> if they had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some absolutely ridiculous image and crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote -- that you want to count.
And then it walks in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word for the word, that is going to confuse you, is typical for typical.
In fact the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in your <unk>
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like looking at a whole bunch of people sitting testing -- I mean, the most exciting thing happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there's amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I'd never expected it to be <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What really is about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security covered with tape just leaving two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I was covered a year before. I had the idea that I could <unk> in a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and numbers of the phone, but it's actually not the point.
These are just tricks. <unk> that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be building <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight, about how their mind.
And we often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of <unk> These are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, sort of <unk> kind of care that most of you are not going on in there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there's something I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, and I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our short existence of <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to being human in front of us, who is walking on our side of us -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even care about processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities at all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you should be the kind of person he remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so it <unk> just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home of my parents in a town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody spent watching the television tree, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all I looked at me, and every time I got <unk> and I got back in a <unk> all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> <unk>
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor about the division of organisms, but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder we feel like that, because according to the Financial Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under their roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture brings us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because it's in a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that you use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art <unk>
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> has this round of red <unk> red, which <unk> <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, got another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and read and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are quite so different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drive new technologies, new new solutions for life forms today.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> so we get away from the people.
All of the black -- this is what you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experiment with <unk> we do <unk> on the back and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> years ago.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small on scale.
And something really hard.
So we zoom in to the '80s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
I would take the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become a <unk> that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won on boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the <unk> that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial <unk> we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the <unk>
There are endless fish sticks of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, that this is not <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are kind of frustrated and we started to make the <unk> of new in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new <unk> design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that are <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You get totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when it critical and public and public and general public and general public, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> tourism rise in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild and radical forms, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant and culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new <unk> happened with other star.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to go through the entire architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we all are photographers of architecture, and the building is carried out beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so fast.
It wasn't quite accurate to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more, before knowing if that that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much people <unk>
That's never going to go back to happen, because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, it starts <unk> faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it's actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a way of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell you how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those <unk> <unk>
If that building was built up today, first to get the Internet to search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of innovation, about what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can take the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no single answer to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that accepts something I haven't seen before.
<unk> can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find adequate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in tomorrow will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a <unk> garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve for sports, or to <unk> or even one can be married there at night.
This means that three architects can be able to dream with swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> as <unk> and <unk> like the animals going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we need is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite place.
Find an architect, <unk> and working together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they shape the way to the most <unk> places -- local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does that cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast to their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
He <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think, "How do you couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's kind of confused because even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what his friends, or <unk> they say, don't know who believe.
So a video of her himself, she publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager and <unk> who gets these answers on one of the stages of their most vulnerable and emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving you <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what it is manipulated digitally.
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> are still dominating our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not really hard to see what the young young people.
But the boys are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of sport, and the singers in <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, as a price of all other aspects of its identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and studies and other things begin to hurt.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to taxpayers and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenage teenagers are not interested in the <unk> discussions of the classroom because they don't want to call attention to their physical field.
One in five are not attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see it good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, you get a note less than your fellow than your fellow people who don't care about all of the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland.
And it gives independently of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be very clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you are.
The <unk> of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> teenage girls are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, involved in more diet not healthy than you can take them to a food disorder, you eat a food disorder, you eat a food disorder, you can take you to a food <unk>
They've got self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them, and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this for what they make more <unk> decisions like the alcohol of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic relationships with early ages and without protection and damage <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe that they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no greater <unk> rates.
By 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview on a day they don't feel safe in the way they can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs that are available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of programs that are <unk> without realizing it.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children follow our children not only have a positive impact but also an ongoing impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of the crucial starting points for anyone willing to provide a education in their body self-worth that works.
An education is <unk> but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
I think the current status of the way the women are viewed and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as they can see.
All of us can begin by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not as well.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you get a <unk>
In summary, we have to work together as communities, like governments and governments and companies, to change our own culture, so that our children will grow valuing their own person, valuing <unk> diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It's to make a difference in the real world, let's make it be them that they go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you see you see the <unk> of being those who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk>
Your <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is at two seats away. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that I would give him not to have long legs -- they got more skinny, a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her to do this, and we would say <unk> to their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's make our kids the truth.
I think that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They would take the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and we compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today will become safe agents for themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five of November in 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi rabbi, <unk> the leader of the U.S. League <unk>
By <unk> initially was <unk> he was innocent -- but in a prisoner in other <unk> <unk> in the company, they started planning attacks on a dozen <unk> of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Luckily those plans would be given by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the fiber Trade Center in the World Trade Center couldn't be <unk>
Later on, he would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, as he was an American engineer with a <unk> American <unk> Sunday <unk> elementary school who was all possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
So I saw that when people take time to <unk> it doesn't need a lot to get to get the same stuff in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think you need to use all the possible means for everybody to live like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he sat with me and he explained to me that in the last weekends he and some friends had been going to <unk> I throw it on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go to the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> who, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold my father on my shoulder and explained to me how to point the goal to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot was the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of all, especially of me, the whole goal was on fire.
My uncle went back to everybody else, and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
<unk> such a parent, such child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> by putting a <unk> <unk> of explosives into the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone is a moment of packing and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class I was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white <unk> but to be the new of the class -- silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say <unk> <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was raised by the people with base indicators in <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during 2000 <unk>
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> on the subject of youthful violence, as I was a victim <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids with whom we had done <unk>
I took several days to go out to the light this detail and I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
Every life had been taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat <unk> people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is a homosexual but I know what is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with the character.
In many ways he turned my figure back in a moment that I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better road. That even though I gave up to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me to <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism -- talking, against those meaningless acts as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I show you here as a proof that violence is not an inherent for any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you indeed.  Thank you indeed.
And at this point, there's a film that projects in your minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
Do your body, your pain, your famine, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that you project to your eyes.
And it is constantly a <unk> voice in your own conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal <unk> you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have an <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
<unk> is the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we can do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate your consciousness into science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science of nature, is objective is objective is objective about it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because during almost all the 20th century, I will have that vision.
<unk> psychology studied <unk> <unk> neuroscience was the <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
And even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything began to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints until the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of these kinds of things in the fantastic work that made Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot of better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or to feel happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a <unk> science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are going to be <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No <unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no problems that are easy to consciousness.
Well, not address the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is it an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do they operate the <unk> how do they work <unk> how are the <unk> and <unk> the living organisms, all of these are questions about how it works.
That could be apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we talk, how we have <unk> all of these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to tell us at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry accounts for the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Its crazy idea is that there's no such problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes sort of an illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain, the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power to him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying as the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that you've got, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take a few aspects of the universe as fundamental <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like quantum laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental properties and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they look fundamental and where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space -- time, <unk> law, so they applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, time, mass, because of the question of logic, you have <unk>
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is we need to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, the physical processes.
<unk> sometimes tell you that we want critical laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws that we could get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by mind, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or that they <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think <unk> I always run at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some <unk> <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anyone think something so crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just as others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems to be a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever you have information processing, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human being, like a human consciousness, complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple <unk>
A very exciting thing is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I mean <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a level of integration integration, it's equally meaningful -- degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the <unk> <unk> particles are the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a whole bunch of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying it.
Like Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had been consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information, she has an complicated information, integrated information so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you know, they have a lot of serious ethical problems with intelligent computer systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the conscience of the collective collective collective <unk>
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, now we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you need seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing that the consciousness is a fundamental thing, that it's universal.
<unk> raises a lot of questions, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, that's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we will finally go to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
We may just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, an underwater profile.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, I <unk> my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem here."
She hasn't actually gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a low profile on my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this one child had been experiences with disability as <unk> objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, the disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lie to disability.
Yes, you've got the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> <unk>
Is it a bad thing and live with a disability you makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and you can't make <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without your hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn -- because they <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people with <unk> people.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that I have weird <unk> <unk> expressing who believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this will happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was standing up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability to people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's make a few things.
But the things that we <unk> aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was told by the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society we live that because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the commons.
They're simply using their bodies to take the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, and share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And why is it going to happen.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not even inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't think I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to upload the battery from the mobile phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and <unk> of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but to a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that we're sold to disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a strain of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> front of a television screen, I'm not going to show the <unk> <unk> for <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of an bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to make all those books a <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't be considered <unk> nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability to be <unk> from the bed and remembering our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade in a high school is not a little wonder that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> don't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at augmented reality and football with the <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think really <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and cell phones.
So how do we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, this is what I'm wearing the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what's running through the field of play to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like that a <unk> man <unk> us trying to do it all its being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So you get some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the helmet, give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine moving up the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in a soccer football perspective.
You have to realize that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is about a little bit more to the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how do we get the next <unk>
We take it on that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably know about.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, three.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will the experience of a fan of <unk>
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching a ball on the bottom of the network? Or you know, <unk> a <unk> in <unk>
What will your experience be when you get a mountain to more than 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe they <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's only virtual reality.
How do we achieve reality <unk> <unk>
It <unk> augmented reality, when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a brief review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
So in <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see your next self in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in front of them, you don't have to worry about to forget a <unk>
You put the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want to do it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium by having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information, you send them into your <unk>
The good teams know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This <unk> the good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being just for <unk>
will be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the <unk>
We <unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- <unk> that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't <unk> it, but the <unk> system is <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you <unk> there's an open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. But the receptor sees in its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The audience <unk> and the fans have continued to move it from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the party.
So I'm going to do a lot of people -- because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use just as bread and <unk> as our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally to be in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth worth of a <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality.
The questions we do and the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as a always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years <unk> the south end of the county south of <unk> County that includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Ocean Ocean and its inspiring <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the <unk> head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical or practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that spend under the <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that don't usually be <unk> in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this method of suicide will realize the <unk> death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
So here's where most people are in order before they take their life.
I can tell you an experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darkest time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer looking at her life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back over the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who would give suicide, but the officials as well.
So we've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans <unk> and psychologists train the new <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on July 22 last year when I got a call from a potential subject to be sitting in the cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a official <unk> officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth to a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
She stopped <unk> he leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind and New Jersey guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I spoke to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had <unk>
<unk> collateral damage will affect a lot of people.
I ask these questions these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved them was <unk>
What do you <unk>
What does it say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel it, because you probably don't know it.
It's just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save her life and will be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing that you can do in the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing that the <unk>
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends talking to their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike is not home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never got there.
I called the police in <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness -- I had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the last day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without a real <unk> disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go out forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I wrote a radio call by the possible <unk> of the bridge to suicide <unk> near the bridge <unk>
I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, it immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half later, I heard Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided on his mind that day will come back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came out, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made it <unk> and <unk> the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of September March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months ago, completely unconscious, all of all of those <unk> traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> when I visited the General San Francisco at the night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and its depression that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was killed with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, stealing the opportunity to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want your own pain in <unk>
Typically, this is achieved only by three ways: to sleep, or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> in three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we come to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who jumped out of the bridge, and they can talk about it, that one percent or <unk> most of those people have said that the second one they leave on the side they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do is something that all and every one of us should be <unk>
suicide can prevent.
There are hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way.
When I became a model, I felt that I finally had the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to go over later when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who are around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I recorded as <unk> at birth because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you have this shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped me share my story, not because I thought I will be the bad thing, but why the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who lie to me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Indian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came out to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I still wear a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> <unk> competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was hanging out of the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and a third <unk> a <unk> of over 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was <unk> of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that she passed my request from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like traveling and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know what if you <unk> the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to perform the most sophisticated and safe surgeries to do.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power or being able to get a <unk> but for me it was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> her truth, but he <unk> he put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November of November we make a global <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I am coming out of the closet.
I can't follow my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer <unk> of 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you --   <unk> <unk> -- a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
I have a support, to my parents especially, to my family, that I know is very strong.
And I remember all the times that I've been going to <unk> young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't take it, and they told me that his parents couldn't take his phone, and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other <unk> It's just gender identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody assigned us to get a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that hasn't a block, and there should be a space that allowed him to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies, the parents are generally known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who knows about her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when you were born, a child, their birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome for his father, and for his mother.
The neighborhood comes out of their <unk> to mother and no one <unk> a father.
And a mother was getting a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, he <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother of suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter, <unk> as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home, and the school admits of her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
Can you play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you noticed it from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and her brothers and her family and her family, and if I had the code of that <unk> I could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this of course is code, not only affects the lives of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members in the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of her sisters on behalf of the honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and that accepts the decisions of their father and mother and women's choices even if they don't will.
If you get the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if you have a old man, she has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young thing, you have to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> his daughter and the lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a fascinated <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so much for her.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came out, when she was four, and I was a half and a half and a half and a half, in my school.
Why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
A <unk> to school means that it's in the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore its potential for its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the <unk> <unk> form and was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on your personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up with the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of the BBC, he offered her same for New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he was embarrassed by ear to my wife and <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the right thing.
<unk> your life for the cause of <unk> because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe severe pains, because his facial <unk> was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we have learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when they didn't end his task.
You fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there special in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so <unk> expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain about 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the TED group, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today is about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You're still as smart or not?
Is it going to be like that, you can go back to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, <unk> but it was the dead sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations and <unk> and try to <unk> them to keep living with life.
More than I've been saved by a time.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to <unk> to try to get the <unk> dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying <unk> and I was struck by looking at how small changes in the doses would dramatically change my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with the others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and a typical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --    of course, many times in the past I've known a number of different guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that I had on the front, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my thinking creative, my flow of ideas.
I used to think about it almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference, how do I get these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in a similar way.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today you have to challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the brain works, for me is simple -- for most of us, mental images are fundamental for <unk> thinking.
And so, after several years, I got to find the point right and I've already got lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really <unk> and well <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music in his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as a way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two recent groups of neuroscience.
They both used MRI using functional MRI imaging to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The <unk> column shows you the scan of the brain of that same individual as you get away, seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the core of the central column on the left.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then, I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, and as much as a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain information of the scanning of it, and I'll show you what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're pretty close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you can imagine that same image, you think of the brain the same <unk>
This was conducted with the largest network systems that are available today, and their resolution was up to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do that?
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
So many of you are proposing new techniques of projection by images, even <unk> with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but to this point, magnets more <unk> just offer small improvements in the resolution of the resolution of thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than bigger magnets -- let's make better magnets.
Can we create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort on MRI was to make <unk> really big magnets right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and <unk> solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and frequency <unk> in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field of magnetic field, <unk> magnetic patterns.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to <unk> our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of the language and communicate directly by <unk>
What would you be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few choices to open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it's going to take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone you're pregnant, or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for the one that you have ever <unk> in life.
<unk> is a very difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived there and have come out of that closet is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> I didn't <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be <unk> that by the <unk> of my pants and my pants -- I had my head -- I would just ask myself a little boy -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I should have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took a little breath, and I went down and I went down and I went down to my backs -- a pink dress with a pink dress and looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you a kid or <unk>
So I took a big breath, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw clothes from a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. <unk>
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation. It was the easiest conversation.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color the color is.
You just know how a feels like a feels like in a closet.
That's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my own, was harder to get out of his, but this is the <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared in bank banking is harder than telling that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your son of five years to tell your three-year-old son.
There's no more difficult thing, only the hard thing.
We need to stop <unk> which is difficult with respect to how difficult for someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make it feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine I know 20 years ago.
I, that had a horse, a horse and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the lesbian <unk> prepared to fight any child in four years to walk into the coffee.
I was frozen by the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and moving only a muscle is the hardest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, full people, who I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world was turning around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill you.
One of my <unk> <unk> was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to be gay, and as I were to make my <unk> lady in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who were known for me to do years.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
They were once in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and has never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> Will Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for me desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
That's how hard conversations are still to be my strong point.
Ask anyone who has been <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to come out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> armor. Be yourself.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that might change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, more important --  Let the complex ones.
You communicate their minds.
They would never be <unk> for that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not my own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark couple of <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back to a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and the Earth or the Earth of the Earth and you have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save us ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence -- they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, up to a certain point in time, asteroids that would explain the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that you can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that are <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement <unk> there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex jobs.
And so, taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I asked a number of years ago: There is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a <unk> <unk> that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choice with a <unk> force with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, to an imminent future while <unk>
In short, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the choices open.
And so, in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> in their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for smart beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy and long-term entropy in any system that can be found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence testing, play games, and even make money -- <unk> actions, all of that without the right thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human foot here, we see <unk> <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate cooperate throwing opposite extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we look at <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keep the network right now.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a series of <unk> <unk> in a whole series of <unk> <unk> to increase assets under their development exponentially.
This risk of risk will have massive applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> of smart cognitive behaviors, such as use tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all of them have one single equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the early use of the word -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were going to die, smart machines, would have a rebellion <unk>
<unk> <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first get smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all contrast, that the impulse to take control of every future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How is it that looking for goals to be <unk> from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of inflection in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, what points on Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intensity <unk> <unk> of stars when planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth on our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The Apollo year was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us since this is now <unk> in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale caused rapidly our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet being influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like Earth, more I enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and even though it's a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this for a mission like the Kepler as the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking its surface to search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that are <unk> as the <unk> mission -- take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
<unk> companies are now offered not only short space flights but also <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images, you remind us to remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and higher places on the Earth, the air is fresh and full of <unk> oxygen from our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets going to get a big and sad <unk> and the belief in some of the things that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
So for a lot that I like the <unk> exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on us that the party of truth will be later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and land preservation are not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment. The paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, Fermi <unk> <unk> in mind that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider how to continue to live in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are <unk> this development.
It's arrogant think that only colonization, <unk> save us from ourselves, but <unk> exploration, and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put together the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk> them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all were very closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from Jeff friend to spend the night because I had an early flight in Europe to the next morning, and I <unk> my passport and <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than one <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going to show it well.
I'm a profession of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> which increases the heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I had no passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in her place, that would be able to put things out of bad things.
Or at least, if things happen, if things happen, you know, you will have the chance that it's a total catastrophe going to be a total catastrophe going on.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't happen.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was a winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed to tell him about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared shared with me who had been practicing something called something called <unk> retrospective with me called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you with is some of the things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you take a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish, the <unk> trees where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody actually did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not as good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing keys for the car and read and <unk>
So in the house, a place for the keys, a hook alongside the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your <unk> a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of his credit cards <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by mail themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases <unk>
The <unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
