So part of the hands-on practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put systems on their site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one thing to be wanted to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making of medical decisions, and in fact making financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take out of a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you're going to the doctor and the doctor say, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease attack the heart, <unk>
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And perhaps you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today. Even likely you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is because of the most doctors don't want to talk about, and the drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to be able to be able to be able to get a medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think of what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not fault of the doctor, and if it's somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you get a person?
300.
This according to the research of researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart attack, stroke, or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a further statistic and it's <unk> from the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
You remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So you think about how to do this with time, so they don't have to make the reasoning of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that helps you help you.
I don't say that they should not take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with his doctor.
The medical ethic is need, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that the most is done in the older men of 50, <unk> prostate prostate by cancer, the number of treating is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of the questions that you can make to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a choice, a lot of times, want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk and think about now, with your family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face <unk> face with a predatory system, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, not very quickly, they might get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window for those times of stress is the rational logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a while.
The idea is to think of the future how they could be those <unk> to put the systems on the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent things wrong in the first place.
<unk> at night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination with the door, with a key <unk> key to the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I have not <unk> and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I am not very <unk> but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of a <unk> tree -- there is that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs of French signs came over the <unk> and at the time of time, it mixed with local signals, and developed the language that we are now known as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, are really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a human world -- it's like I lived in a foreign country to <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do you understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I have learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of <unk> <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we don't <unk> it in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk>
Maybe I think of sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound that's about coming next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent of sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
And yet, to me, do my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just got four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
For this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that point, the sound was the <unk> and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experienced through the ears.
I can feel <unk> or experience it visually, or even an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my artistic practice in my
And everything that had been taught to me, as the sound of sound, decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could <unk>
I chose to love me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same way and become my voice.
In that way, I am able to be relevant in our current society.
So in school, on work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
<unk> by asking for his voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan in a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could <unk> it in the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said to <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different <unk> <unk>
If you assigned a different <unk> for every finger as the facial expression, the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand, the speed, the form of hand and so, while you touch the piano, English is a linear language, like if you get just one button to the same time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in order to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If it just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning for it.
The same thing happens to the music in terms of and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- they can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in it."
This is the <unk> sign in it."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and <unk> it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is that <unk>
If you pick it up, and you look at the speed -- visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel like the same thing can be said to <unk>
All right?
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel like the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, two hands, and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per <unk>
And yet, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> the same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands on high hands.
Now we're going to do it so much in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a story is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
You see how the three signs are very similar -- all the things that happen in the head and the chest. But they transmit very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and distant as the music.
But today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you have to hear music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to get to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love from us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents were told to me, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an <unk> bubble or a bubble of ignorance -- I mean, the adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and they're not really good at cleaning the other people.
The time country, I'm now adult and teach citizenship and invention for Hong <unk> in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the <unk> <unk> with lots of trash <unk>
So as good citizens, I cleaned the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't have it."
It's sad to speak, but more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to gather those bits of plastic pieces to study under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, six to 15 years old, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of work with <unk> <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate in.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who manipulate electric tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it into the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to <unk> in something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children would get very much to robots.
And then we created what we call "A <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we can transform light bulbs and web chambers and <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and through the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic from the way through the sensor while the computer on board process this picture and measuring the size of every particle to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in water.
<unk> this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will be <unk>
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve it right away.
I'm going to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, they look at the Internet, and you get <unk> with this image: <unk>
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that you drink is the water in which they <unk> the water where they <unk> the place where they live?
You can see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown in brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's really hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what is in the water.
We <unk> this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe address a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it <unk> several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than <unk> people died at a instant.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power <unk> to water.
And today, according to reports from 300 tons of <unk> are still <unk> from the nuclear plant in the Pacific ocean.
Today, the entire ocean Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation has disappeared from the <unk> coast and most of the time, and the majority of the time, has absolutely <unk> it's blue.
Well, it's a bit more complicated than that.
I have gone back to <unk> every year since the crash and research <unk> with other scientists, the ground, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we informed the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their lives.
Along with them we discussed the <unk> data that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a mile from the nuclear <unk> and with the foreign aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea level with a <unk> array of sediment -- as we invented and built it.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, very simple scales and very simple open-source technology.
But at the same time, it has been more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should get the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turning it into the largest space, dedicated to the social impact and environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact of the environmental impact
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, chemistry, a bit of biology, basically, you can build almost everything out there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with the help of adults -- and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or you can help in the mobility of the age of the age to transforming their <unk> <unk> in new <unk> vehicles.
<unk> oil and <unk> are terrible, terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the kids in the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So <unk> scientific citizens, we have to get to the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different <unk> cultures.
One is made from thousands of different pieces of steel -- another one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic.
One is <unk> over the environment -- I thought it was it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggles to be free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information required for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> from manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world that's done of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material <unk> in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk> <unk>
The <unk> are more thick with small <unk>
You acts mostly as the filter that is the other mostly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- <unk> twice the personality of every designer and the architect to work on the moment between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth between the assembly and growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere, and <unk> it shows on the two screens after me.
My job at the most simple level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment in history, a weird, where you have four disciplines that gives designers access to the tools that we had never had access before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> base that some day not very far to print <unk> <unk> and graphics and nanoscale <unk> made of genetically modified <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every <unk> is the only size to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion fashion <unk> with <unk> <unk> it's like a second skin made from a single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with the collaborator of 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> <unk> <unk> and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments, it allows you to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissue.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair and comfortable <unk> and also absorb sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and in designing this <unk> pattern of <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the points of pressure in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, their functionality is not using the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continually <unk>
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious village, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and got to define a lot of what you care.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, <unk> leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the land made it grow trees with twigs, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a whole world <unk>
I often ask myself, "What would the design would be if the objects were made from a <unk>
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons that are produced by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can <unk> their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We <unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures, it built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material of the march and create these structures made from a single 3.5 meters of long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it to dry it to find a natural way in contact with the air.
So why are we still designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the <unk> processes were used to contain <unk> <unk> which came out for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition with no problems of beam <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
It works with an old material, one of the first forms of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that acts as a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> <unk> life and placed on the ground, will grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next exploring <unk> was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
So as the <unk> table, we did our own table of items, new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new biological <unk> inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, you get two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human genome.
It turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuel for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the vocal tract -- that will help us <unk> these bacteria and to <unk> their function of the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the <unk>
If we wanted to get more <unk> they <unk> more transparent.
This <unk> system <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it's about 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in life inside clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are working <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would make the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that will increase matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the <unk> tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a form of edit the biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always need to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer <unk> material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture.
The manufacturing is not <unk> at this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which puts those fibers between it.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first becomes in the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, come in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet, to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk <unk>
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat <unk> not inside a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> <unk> directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms up to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the smooth silk without a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing <unk> and we put it in our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- distributes the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms from silk to a paper farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they get eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
So by <unk> the biological silk of silk silk. They give it all this pavilion over the integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 dollars in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to make the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
The thing that takes us to turn, of course, at the beginning.
This is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that led to a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands of us, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> it with your toes.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school, I liked the English English -- and the art and the <unk> and the websites, also played the guitar, in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I went down to the other thing, something completely different, and I'm going to get involved in it, and I'm going to get <unk> and I have found the <unk> and then back this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it out.
But then I'd like to find something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me so much anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because it wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, and my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason why it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more <unk>
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk>
I worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to ask for me then.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you <unk> it from the culture.
You ask ourselves, first "What do you want to be from <unk>
When we have five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would <unk>
It's considered a naive question to provoke the kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> here.
This question is a question over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to pick up the university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by the kids to dream of what might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite of it, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what nice but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned on <unk> <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is that they're going to have to choose to.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is really <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real vocation, the idea that every one of us has something to do for your time on this ground, and you have to figure out what that thing is and spend your life on it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that come up with curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help you divide into three parts: potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the course of the Renaissance the ideal was the ideal who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> yourself.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or woe you have to beat.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three <unk> <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection.
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualizing the mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix and experiences.
The innovation happens at the intersections.
It comes out of the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, they can get to a lot of these points of intersection.
The second <unk> <unk> is fast learning.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we're going to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was so many times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of proving new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we have so rarely we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a complete <unk> and an independent writer for independent time.
As a girl, <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned out, it was financial <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when he was beginning to <unk> and this ability to write compelling <unk> for editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to go to what you would ask -- even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is the ability to transform anything you needed in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, a few pages of pages of pages of pages -- sometimes consultant, of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in <unk> to <unk>
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly by knowing that they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best equipment is made of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep and put ideas in practice and <unk> it offers an breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are <unk> with how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're connected to how we're
And unfortunately to <unk> in large part of the way that they are just more like your fellow <unk>
I once said that, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then, you know, <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will do the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just realized about being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many <unk>
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring takes us to more authentic and happy.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> he took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If you could have been living today, we could not give it to her more help than that was <unk> <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to have a diagnostic diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has done a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But gradually has been done in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's more than a decade.
So I think this all the time.
<unk> now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million who, by the way, include many of you.
If you are expecting to live until 85 years or more, the chance to contract a Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there's the likelihood that they spend their years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
Only in America, caring for 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease -- and their costs will increase five times in 2050, the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first top causes of death from the entire world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow down.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The United States government spends 10 times the United States government spends 10 times more in the cancer research that we have the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause a similar number of deaths like the cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all the scientists, <unk> <unk> with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a healthy young brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical harm caused by this disease.
In addition to <unk> a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the harm of the brain caused by Alzheimer's to reduce life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's has found <unk> <unk> in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as origami.
There's places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it moves, well, these <unk> dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points are left in the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> between each other, forming groups that can make big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We have spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the memory of how much we block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step of the right step of it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physical, engineers, engineers and mathematician.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some of the videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see it moving with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that they stick to each other in them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome -- but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease, and that if we <unk> it we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure.
That was essential to advance HIV treatment in the late '80s.
We see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not the most genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain run the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
In order to fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience of testing it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to make 36 and more personal and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last possible <unk>
And <unk>
So <unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal and more personal <unk>
Number three: <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like to do from him or her -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you have just met.
When I stumbled upon this study a few years ago, a big detail was called me attention -- the gadget two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also <unk>
And when I had the chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
And yet, we went down and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the spine to <unk>
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably are wondering, They go together <unk>
And the reason I think it's challenging this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And from this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before he put the paper was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had met writing about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog ticket can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually only my friends from Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably been a few thousand views.
And that turns out a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he came over, I had no idea.
The paper was published on line on a Friday at night, and on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And on Sunday, I had been called <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month -- the paper got over eight million <unk> and I was to say something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence to write about their own <unk> experience, but another thing is to find that the romantic life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always the same question: <unk> still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase: <unk> follow <unk>
And several messages came up there.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was inspired by radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman cried to the stage, "Hey, <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers by proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public onset together.
<unk> interviews, <unk> interviews, and he refused for pictures of us.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if I was able to produce <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, above all, that people said the wrong question.
How do you know if you <unk> together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 times less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to make romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at interpersonal <unk> between university students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
Participants felt more close to doing it, several <unk> studies, also used <unk> protocol, <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community. And they've used it between people of opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer -- that combines personal questions with four minutes.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal university university and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you love the person with whom you <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that I did get better to test the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
And yet, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled upon the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost my adult life, and he was my first love, and he had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took it into science.
I did all that I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that could be able to have a certain <unk>
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to work for the book that I would write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was invited to the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what you get.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than any of what reasonably people can demand me.
And what I look for is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> endlessly by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were all together.
The story that the media said about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk and this is a very <unk> story, because <unk> makes us feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that you say, are still <unk>
And their content with a <unk> response or No.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love, and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love anybody.
So if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year ago, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, and we're going to get together, and I'm very <unk>
But <unk> is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> <unk> didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would take that decision, and how long it will have to follow that choice without knowing before, if he always chose to do it or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and respond to 36 questions, I'd have chosen to love someone as nice and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth where I don't really believe it.
And what I <unk> and what I may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article -- which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't really wrote.
But what I have is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised for <unk> <unk> and in some way I got a <unk> of the forest.
 In New York City.  Something really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and it <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a knife in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humanoid <unk> would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment he was in <unk> <unk> it likes to go from walking and <unk> and all those <unk> things and was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I covered the <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more adventure on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, in some way it seemed to grow it up, as if it was that we would get the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements -- frogs that I would find out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own <unk> of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> of the ones that you can get an idea.
Then I made a few insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and stuff, and I was earning some money, to dinner, for example, to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because he was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing on a window, and then another window, and he had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know that.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds <unk>
<unk>
It has double faces, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
You're in the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh mesh where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animal heads are run into the <unk> lists for <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god strapped to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> bin Laden, there's all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand goes out as the other hand goes out.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps Earth and cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird, like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> a <unk> tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn off the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> of 1986.
They've got <unk>
They were done in the 1960s as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
<unk> for his time.  This brings me to my final project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> and dictionaries.
But each of you acts as a kind of archive in the way of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are as cells, they come together, divide it.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest. It can be <unk>
You can see it for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game <unk>
This is two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a writer a writer -- a <unk> a museum, a <unk> a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in inside it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the <unk> the <unk> and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any human medicine in the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take <unk> drugs, these are the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the <unk> cells.
But they are also known by their side effects -- mostly negative, because in the time that it takes it to the blood current -- <unk> and worse for the time that it would take it to your fate, which is where most importantly, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the <unk> of the patients who are being used to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life -- <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, let's get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you are used to <unk> for wounds and surgery surgery can be used for anything <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, and they open up and close and close the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asked, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful beam of laser membrane on the cell membrane infected while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a question of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro and <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, it's our laser, we'll do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head -- which is a camera, it's moving the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug -- it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV from the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, the armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to a confrontation is not violent.
I do work of the field, in the politics of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and <unk> actors.
For example, the <unk> deals with <unk> <unk> between 1975.
So we have to understand these <unk> even we have <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful <unk>
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but no one looks at what they do when they didn't work.
The armed struggle and political struggle is <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global worldview.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1960s -- <unk> has also set up a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the World Bank since 2007.
So these groups make more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking <unk>
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations, radio stations, Internet Internet sites and social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine <unk> in English and published <unk>
armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising.
These activities are different.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funding, to recruit their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else -- create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running a professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not safe and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan <unk> by war or even the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> can be also <unk> the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the default victory in 2006 was <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed groups, and political groups, participate in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated things are these organizations, we can find it something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, running all its <unk> collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a <unk> It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of <unk> nations and hybrids and the more weak the states, like the Middle East today, more <unk> and they fill that gap <unk>
This is important for governments, because to <unk> these groups will have to invest more in tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace together.
If we understand better groups -- let's understand better than the incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, actors, the military power can win some <unk> but we won't deliver peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that <unk> to fill that gap of the government that enabled these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure like a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I fear accepting <unk> tag would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I'm going to have a bad feminist <unk>
Or at least, I wrote a paper and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews -- people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke is going to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me get a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had weird ideas about the <unk> these women, <unk> with men and they hated sexual activity, as if that was bad.
Today, I see how women are treated for women around the world, and anger, in particular it seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using the people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I <unk> myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, high self-esteem and dare to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine someone else.
At the time, as I went growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender gender and <unk> and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We have to have to account these differences and how do we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist <unk>
I have another confession.
When I run the job, I hear rap music, all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and offends me, deeply, the classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Just think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical exercises.
I strongly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do --   all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> the grass and the maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink <unk>
<unk> from fashion magazines and <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have the <unk> of the fairy tales, that they make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I am not who you <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, <unk> that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, <unk> workers, gay women, white women, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that is a very bad feminist feminist <unk>
It also happens, as a <unk> I feel very pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be <unk>
When we <unk> we take a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I think of myself before I would try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that label is fear of fear not to be able to achieve with <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> of 2014, <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of 3,000 meters tall.
It was a show -- looking at this star <unk> embracing feminism and doing the women and the young men who will be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics really began the endless debates if they were not just a feminist <unk>
It will be <unk> instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
We <unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We're going to get far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it wasn't there.
We don't need to do that.
The bad insight or more well, one feminism more inclusive is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to <unk> and will be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a human supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> climate change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have his music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when the bad decisions were denied this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, gender equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> and bright and too <unk> I want to grow in a world.
where they are <unk> by strong creatures that are.
I think of all of a sudden, the best option was <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when films don't treat women more than <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk> <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in his project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to participate in this kind of projects, we can also help them to be included even more like us to get the barriers to <unk>
We already are not necessarily <unk> without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, people in the power and cinema and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more brave and really significant and significant change.
We can also tell with bravery our fear -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist <unk> not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, above all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a incident to make front of what happened.
Some of the guys were <unk> when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I didn't get scared to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of women who looked at me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the script, I also found that if it was a <unk> another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is about to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope we all can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas in the past year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things <unk> from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the paper that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines are <unk> <unk> and marked by being an fraud <unk> by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't think most of the intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of <unk> estimates in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered very bizarre disease.
The very few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about she believed to develop every professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates are still stable as only three or four children for every <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers began to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> referred to routinely by autism as an epidemic.
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people from the Center for Disease Control <unk> what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better <unk> detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who is looking for the face of his two years, the eye contact for you.
If the diagnostic criteria had to <unk> why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so difficult to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but it was discovered, but that story turns out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a infant psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> he published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to <unk> <unk> worlds <unk> the people of her around, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by shaking their faces, but they were prey from panic for their faces, but they were prey from panic for <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in their usual place, without knowing them.
On the base of the <unk> patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is really weird.
For the 1950s as the main authority of the world in the subject, I found that I had seen less than 150 real cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from very distant places, like South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned to nine of every 10 children sent for other doctors to their office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> <unk> for cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have kept very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic would be able to distinguish between 18 steps before they hit the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> I had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents -- they were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning into invisible to the world in general.
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> moms was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a nice autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl, no special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
In order to defend for the National Service that they needed more resources for autistic children and families, <unk> and their colleague Judith <unk> decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence of prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
The thing that you saw was that the model model was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more beautiful, and so on.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> on their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these children didn't fit into nice frames and <unk> as they said, <unk> and saw a bunch of them, so much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Initially, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How no one had no <unk> of these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to a paper published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competence, but avoided <unk> <unk> in his own job.
There was not even a translation of the English -- but thankfully the husband of <unk> he would speak German, and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
Her author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinic integrated with a internship in <unk> in the 1930s.
So the ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with <unk> with music, and kids follow their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of the cause of autism, <unk> described as disability to <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating the kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he took to help in the development methods that were particularly appropriate for them.
<unk> he saw autism as a diverse continuum that <unk> an amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond until I mean, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnostic that we <unk> the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for each broad and <unk>
These changes didn't fell in <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked on each other to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an autism adult for the first time.
Before it came out, <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced early clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact that they were able to get the people with autism and their families eventually <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in <unk> a simple simple simple one, and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the <unk> center that one of these 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum -- it's right, <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people's people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical developments -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a deficit deficit to details.
No doubt, people are working to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover for <unk> the ship from the <unk>
As you move to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
